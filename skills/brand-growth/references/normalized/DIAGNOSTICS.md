# DIAGNOSTICS

## Brand Growth Audit — Key Questions

### Step 1: Penetration vs. Loyalty Diagnosis
- What is our current penetration rate (% of category buyers buying us)?
- What is competitor penetration? Are we following Double Jeopardy Law norms?
- Is our loyalty (purchase frequency) high relative to our penetration — or normal for our size?
- **Interpretation**: If loyalty looks "high" but penetration is low, growth is still limited. Penetration must increase.

### Step 2: Mental Availability Audit
- How many Category Entry Points (CEPs) is our brand linked to in buyer memory?
- Which CEPs do we own vs. competitors?
- Are we associated with the highest-volume buying situations in the category?
- How frequently do we advertise to light buyers and non-buyers?
- Does our advertising reach all category buyers or just our current customers?
- **Red flags**: Narrow CEP footprint, advertising only to existing customers, low unaided brand awareness.

### Step 3: Physical Availability Audit
- Are we present in all the channels where category purchases happen?
- What is our distribution breadth vs. competitors?
- Is our brand easy to find at point of purchase (shelf presence, search visibility, ease of reordering)?
- Are there purchase occasions where we are absent?
- **Red flags**: Low distribution in key channels, hard to find online, missing from e-commerce platforms.

### Step 4: Distinctive Brand Assets Audit
- Which DBAs (colors, logo, tagline, jingle, mascot) do we own?
- Are they Famous (widely recognized) AND Unique (linked only to us)?
- Are we consistently using DBAs across all touchpoints?
- Have we recently changed or diluted key DBAs?
- **Red flags**: Low DBA uniqueness, inconsistent use across channels, recent rebranding that erased memory structures.

### Step 5: Advertising Reach Audit
- What is the reach of our current advertising (% of category buyers exposed)?
- Are we over-investing in frequency to existing customers vs. reach to light/non-buyers?
- Is our creative consistent enough to refresh memory structures without massive frequency?
- **Red flags**: High frequency to small audience, narrow targeting by demographics only.

## Common Growth Problems and Root Causes

| Symptom | Likely Root Cause | Evidence-Based Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Brand not growing despite loyal customers | Insufficient penetration | Increase reach to light buyers and non-buyers |
| Declining share despite good loyalty rates | Mental availability eroding | Increase advertising reach and CEP coverage |
| High awareness but low purchase | Physical availability gaps | Expand distribution; improve shelf presence |
| Losing to private label | Weak DBAs or price premium unjustified | Invest in DBA distinctiveness; justify premium |
| B2B brand overlooked in shortlisting | Low mental availability in buying committee | Broaden reach to all committee members |
| Growing in niche but not at scale | CEP footprint too narrow | Expand to higher-volume CEPs |

- **Mental availability / salience**: Unaided brand awareness in category buying situations.
- **CEP linkage score**: Number of CEPs linked to brand in prompted surveys.
- **Distribution / numeric distribution**: % of relevant outlets carrying the brand.
