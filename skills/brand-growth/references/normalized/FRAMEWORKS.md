# FRAMEWORKS

## Mental Availability Framework
Mental availability is the probability that a buyer thinks of a brand when entering a buying situation.

### Category Entry Points (CEPs)
- CEPs are the situations, goals, and motivations that trigger a category purchase (e.g., "I need a quick lunch", "I need to reduce IT costs").
- Brands should build memory structures linked to the most common and high-volume CEPs in the category.
- A brand with broad CEP coverage has higher mental availability than one linked to few CEPs.
- Diagnostic questions:
  - Which CEPs does our brand own? Which do competitors own?
  - How many CEPs are we linked to in buyer memory?
  - Are we associated with the highest-volume CEPs or niche ones?

### Memory Structures
- Brands are stored in memory as networks of associations linked to CEPs.
- Effective advertising refreshes and broadens these memory links rather than creating new brand identities.
- Consistent Distinctive Brand Assets (DBAs) strengthen memory retrieval across CEPs.

### Reach and Fresh Buying
- Mental availability decays without advertising — brands must continuously reach non-buyers and light buyers.
- Reach (breadth of audience) matters more than frequency for mental availability building.

## Physical Availability Framework
Physical availability is how easy it is for buyers to find, choose, and buy a brand.

### Distribution Breadth
- More distribution outlets = more chances for a buyer to encounter and purchase the brand.
- Gaps in distribution directly reduce penetration ceiling.

### Shelf Presence and Salience
- In-store (or online shelf) salience: being noticed and easily identified at point of purchase.
- Distinctive packaging and brand elements enhance physical salience.

### Channel and Occasion Coverage
- Brands should be present in every channel and occasion where the category is bought.
- Missing a high-volume purchase occasion is equivalent to not existing for that occasion.

## Double Jeopardy Diagnostic Framework
Use the Double Jeopardy Law to benchmark brand health:

1. Gather penetration (% of category buyers who buy the brand) and loyalty (average purchase frequency) metrics.
2. Compare against Dirichlet norms — are loyalty metrics explained by brand size?
3. If loyalty is "too high" for the brand's size: rare "niche" deviation — investigate if sustainable.
4. If penetration is low but loyalty appears high: often a data artifact or a very loyal but tiny base.
5. Growth prescription: almost always — increase penetration first.

## B2B Brand Growth Framework

- B2B brands must build mental availability across all members of the buying committee, not just the primary contact.
- B2B Category Entry Points include: cost reduction, risk mitigation, digital transformation, compliance, efficiency.
- B2B brand salience correlates with being shortlisted — brands not thought of are not evaluated.
- Reach in B2B: target all potential buyers in the category, not just current accounts.
- Relationship marketing is necessary but insufficient — it does not replace broad brand reach.

## Distinctive Brand Assets (DBA) Framework
- DBAs are non-name elements (colors, shapes, mascots, jingles, fonts) that uniquely and consistently trigger brand retrieval.
- Test DBAs on two dimensions: Fame (% who recognize it) and Uniqueness (% who link it exclusively to the brand).
- High-fame + high-uniqueness assets are the most valuable; protect and consistently use them.
- Low-uniqueness assets are a waste — they build competitors' memory structures too.
