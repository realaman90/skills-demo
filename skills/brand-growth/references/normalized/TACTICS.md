## Evidence-Based Brand Growth Tactics

### 1. Maximise Reach, Not Just Frequency
- Prioritise reaching as many category buyers as possible — including light buyers and non-buyers.
- Use broad media channels (TV, radio, display, broad digital) to achieve category-wide reach.
- Narrow targeting by demographics or psychographics reduces penetration potential.
- Rule of thumb: reach 3x more buyers with 1/3 the frequency before adding more frequency to existing reach.

### 2. Expand Category Entry Point (CEP) Linkages
- Map the most common buying situations in the category (CEPs).
- Create advertising that links the brand to the top 5–10 CEPs by volume.
- Over-investing in a single CEP limits mental availability; spread across multiple CEPs.
- In B2B: identify and own CEPs relevant to each buying committee member (CFO CEPs vs. IT CEPs vs. Operations CEPs).

### 3. Protect and Consistently Apply Distinctive Brand Assets (DBAs)
- Audit existing DBAs for Fame and Uniqueness.
- Double down on high-fame, high-uniqueness assets — use them in every communication.
- Retire or retrain low-uniqueness assets that build competitor memory too.
- Do NOT change DBAs without a strong strategic reason — memory structures built over years erode quickly.

### 4. Improve Physical Availability
- Audit distribution gaps — which channels are underserved?
- Improve shelf presence: packaging designed to be noticed and identified quickly at point of purchase.
- Optimise for online channels: search visibility, ease of reordering, presence on marketplaces.
- In B2B: ensure the brand is easy to find, evaluate, and buy — reduce friction in the procurement process.

### 5. Reach Light Buyers and Non-Buyers with Simple, Consistent Creative
- Light buyers need simple messages that link the brand to relevant CEPs — they won't remember complex narratives.
- Consistent creative (same look, feel, and DBAs) reinforces memory across multiple low-frequency exposures.
- Avoid over-targeting current customers with brand advertising — that is CRM, not brand building.

### 6. Advertising Continuity Over Burst Campaigns
- Continuous advertising at moderate levels is more effective than burst campaigns followed by silence.
- Mental availability decays without advertising — brands that go dark lose salience rapidly.
- Budget continuity is more valuable than large but infrequent campaign bursts.

### 7. B2B-Specific: Broaden Reach Within Buying Committees
- Identify all roles in the buying committee: economic buyer, technical buyer, end user, influencer.
- Build mental availability among all committee members, not just the primary contact.
- Sponsor industry events, trade publications, and LinkedIn broad reach — not just account-based targeting.

### 8. Easy-to-Find Strategy
- Brands should be easy to find at every stage of the buying journey: search, shelf, recommendation, review.
- Optimise for mental availability (they think of you) AND physical findability (they can find you when they do).
