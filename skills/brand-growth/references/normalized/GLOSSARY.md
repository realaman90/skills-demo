# GLOSSARY

## Brand Growth Terminology

### Brand Penetration
The percentage of category buyers who purchase the brand at least once in a given period. The primary metric for brand size. Growing penetration is the primary lever for brand growth.

### Double Jeopardy Law
An empirical law of marketing: smaller brands have BOTH fewer buyers (lower penetration) AND lower loyalty (lower purchase frequency) compared to larger brands. Discovered by William McPhee, applied to marketing by Andrew Ehrenberg.

### Mental Availability
The ease and probability with which a buyer thinks of a brand when entering a buying situation. Built through advertising reach, CEP linkages, and Distinctive Brand Assets. Coined by Byron Sharp / Ehrenberg-Bass Institute.

### Physical Availability
The ease and probability with which a buyer can find, choose, and purchase a brand. Built through distribution breadth, channel coverage, and in-store/online presence.

### Category Entry Points (CEPs)
The specific situations, goals, and motivations that prompt a buyer to enter the category and make a purchase. Examples in food: "quick weekday lunch", "treat for the family", "dinner party dessert". Brands should build memory associations to multiple high-volume CEPs.

### NBD-Dirichlet Model
A stochastic model that predicts brand purchase patterns (penetration, frequency, loyalty) from market share alone. Used to benchmark brand metrics against expected norms. Deviations from Dirichlet indicate unusual brand dynamics.

### Distinctive Brand Assets (DBAs)
Non-name brand cues — colors, logos, shapes, mascots, jingles, slogans — that consistently and uniquely trigger brand recognition and retrieval. Different from brand differentiation. Valued for Fame (recognition) and Uniqueness (exclusive association).

### Fame (of a DBA)
The percentage of category buyers who recognise a brand's distinctive asset. High fame = the asset is well-known.

### Uniqueness (of a DBA)
The percentage of category buyers who link a distinctive asset exclusively to one brand. High uniqueness = the asset is not confused with competitors.

### Light Buyers
Buyers who purchase a brand infrequently (once or twice a year). They represent the majority of a brand's buyers by number and collectively contribute significant volume. The primary growth opportunity for brands.

### Heavy Buyers
Buyers who purchase frequently. They are already buying near their ceiling; marginal growth from heavy buyers is limited. Often over-served by brand loyalty programs.

### Purchase Frequency (W)
Average number of times a buyer purchases the brand in a given period. Predicted by Dirichlet norms based on market share. Not a meaningful differentiator between competing brands of the same size.

### Share of Category Requirements (SCR)
The percentage of a buyer's category purchases that go to a specific brand. A loyalty metric. Also known as "share of wallet" in some contexts.

### 100% Loyal Buyers (S)
Buyers who purchased only one brand in the category during the measurement period. Largely an artifact of purchase frequency (light buyers appear "100% loyal" because they only buy once). Not a reliable indicator of brand loyalty.

### Salience
The propensity for a brand to be noticed or thought of in a buying situation. Closely related to mental availability. A brand with high salience comes to mind readily and is easy to notice at point of purchase.

### Ehrenberg-Bass Institute
A marketing research institute at the University of South Australia, led by Byron Sharp. Produces evidence-based marketing science research including brand growth laws, mental/physical availability, and the NBD-Dirichlet model.

### Reach
The number or percentage of distinct individuals exposed to a brand's communication in a given period. A key metric for advertising effectiveness alongside frequency.

### Frequency
The average number of times an exposed person sees/hears a brand's communication. High frequency with low reach is less efficient for brand growth than broad reach with moderate frequency.
