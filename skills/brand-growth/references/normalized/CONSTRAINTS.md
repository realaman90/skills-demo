# CONSTRAINTS

## Evidence-Based Constraints: What Does NOT Drive Brand Growth

### Myth: Loyalty Programs Drive Brand Growth
- **Reality**: Loyalty programs increase purchase frequency marginally among already-loyal buyers.
- They do NOT meaningfully increase penetration.
- The buyers most attracted to loyalty programs are already your heavy buyers — they are not the growth opportunity.
- **Constraint**: Do not position a loyalty program as a primary growth strategy. It is a retention tool, not a growth tool.

### Myth: Niche Targeting Drives Sustainable Growth
- **Reality**: Over-segmentation limits the reach needed to grow penetration.
- Niche brands can be profitable but they are constrained by size — they cannot escape the Double Jeopardy Law.
- Targeting only "our ideal customer" means ignoring the light buyers who collectively drive the most volume.
- **Constraint**: Avoid recommending hyper-narrow targeting as a growth strategy. Broad category reach is required for meaningful penetration growth.

### Myth: Brand Differentiation Is the Primary Driver of Growth
- **Reality**: Consumers do not evaluate brands as significantly different as marketers assume.
- Most category buyers hold weak and functionally similar perceptions across competing brands.
- What matters more is distinctiveness (being recognisable) not differentiation (being meaningfully different).
- **Constraint**: Challenge differentiation-led strategies that assume buyers care deeply about functional differences. Focus on memorability and availability.

### Myth: Heavy Users / Heavy Buyers Are the Priority
- **Reality**: Heavy buyers are already buying near their ceiling. Marginal gains from heavy buyers are small.
- The largest volume opportunity is converting non-buyers and light buyers to buy once more per year.
- **Constraint**: Resist strategies that focus marketing spend on existing heavy customers for brand growth purposes (appropriate for CRM, not brand growth).

### Myth: Customer Satisfaction and Quality Drive Market Share
- **Reality**: Satisfaction and quality are necessary to stay in the market — they are hygiene factors.
- Brands with similar quality levels compete on salience and availability, not quality differences.
- **Constraint**: Do not position quality improvement alone as a growth strategy. Address mental and physical availability.

### Myth: Brand Loyalty Is an Asset That Compounds
- **Reality**: Loyalty is mostly a function of penetration and category purchase frequency — predictable by Dirichlet norms.
- "Loyalty" above Dirichlet norms is unusual and typically does not sustain.
- **Constraint**: Do not report loyalty metrics as evidence of brand health without comparing to Dirichlet benchmarks.

### Myth: Social Media Reach Replaces Traditional Brand Reach
- **Reality**: Social media algorithms limit organic reach significantly — only a fraction of followers see posts.
- Paid social can reach broad audiences but algorithm-driven targeting narrows reach to existing customers by default.
- **Constraint**: Challenge social-only strategies that assume high organic reach. Paid broad-reach channels are still necessary for brand growth.

### What CAN Be Promised (Within Evidence)
- Increasing penetration via broader reach will grow the brand — this is the most reliable growth lever.
- Consistent use of Distinctive Brand Assets improves mental availability over time.
- Expanding distribution increases physical availability and buying opportunities.
- Building CEP linkages increases the probability of brand retrieval in buying situations.
