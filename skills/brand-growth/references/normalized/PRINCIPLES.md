# PRINCIPLES

## Core Brand Growth Laws

### Double Jeopardy Law
- Smaller brands suffer twice: fewer buyers AND lower loyalty than larger brands.
- Loyalty metrics (purchase frequency, repeat rate) are largely predictable from market share — they are not a source of competitive advantage.
- Brands cannot "escape" double jeopardy through niche positioning alone.

### Penetration Is the Primary Driver of Growth
- Brand growth comes predominantly from acquiring more buyers (penetration), not from increasing loyalty among existing buyers.
- All major brand growth studies find that penetration, not loyalty rate, differentiates large from small brands.
- "Loyalty programs" move loyalty metrics minimally; they rarely drive penetration.

### Light Buyers Are the Growth Opportunity
- The majority of a brand's sales come from light / infrequent buyers.
- Heavy buyers are already buying near their ceiling — they cannot be driven much higher.
- Growing a brand means reaching and converting light category buyers, not over-serving heavy buyers.

### Mental and Physical Availability Are Both Required
- Mental availability: being easily thought of in relevant buying situations (Category Entry Points).
- Physical availability: being easy to find, buy, and use across channels and occasions.
- Neglecting either one creates a growth ceiling regardless of brand quality.

### NBD-Dirichlet: Predictable Buyer Behaviour
- Brand purchase patterns (repeat rate, purchase frequency, sole loyalty) are predictable from market share alone.
- Brands in the same category have similar buyer profiles — heavy vs. light buyers is a category-level phenomenon.
- Deviations from Dirichlet norms indicate anomalies worth investigating.

### The Law of Double Jeopardy in B2B
- B2B brands follow the same laws as consumer brands: smaller B2B brands have fewer buyers and lower engagement.
- Growing B2B brands must also build mental availability in buying committees across all relevant CEPs.
- Relationship-led growth must be complemented by broad reach to expand the buyer pool.

## What Drives Sustainable Brand Growth
- Reach: advertising to all category buyers, especially light buyers and non-buyers.
- Distinctive Assets: consistent use of visual and auditory cues that trigger brand retrieval.
- Category Entry Points: owning mental links to the most common buying situations.
- Wide physical distribution: presence wherever buyers make category decisions.
