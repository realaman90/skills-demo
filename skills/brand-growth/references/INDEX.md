## Normalized Files
- normalized/PRINCIPLES.md — Core brand growth laws (Double Jeopardy, Penetration, Light Buyers, Mental/Physical Availability)
- normalized/FRAMEWORKS.md — Strategic frameworks (CEPs, DBA, Double Jeopardy Diagnostic, B2B Growth, Physical Availability)
- normalized/DIAGNOSTICS.md — Brand growth audit questions and common problem diagnosis
- normalized/TACTICS.md — Evidence-based growth tactics (reach, CEP expansion, DBA consistency, distribution)
- normalized/CONSTRAINTS.md — What does NOT drive growth (myths: loyalty programs, niche targeting, differentiation-only)
- normalized/GLOSSARY.md — Brand growth terminology and definitions
- normalized/PDF_SUMMARIES.md — PDF source summaries with topics and OCR status
- normalized/SOURCE_QUOTES.md — Quote bank from source docs for citations

## Gaps
- Direct verbatim text extraction from PDFs is limited (large/scanned academic PDFs). Enable OCR (ENABLE_OCR=1) for better extraction.
- No explicit voice/tone or examples documentation in source PDFs — this is a strategic knowledge skill, not a copy skill.
- B2B-specific CEP examples not fully enumerated — consult the white paper directly for industry-specific CEPs.
