# ASSIGNMENT GUIDE: Brand Growth Strategy

## Your role vs. the AI's role

**You** do the strategic thinking. **The skill** tests it.

The skill has access to Byron Sharp, the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute research, and every framework in the course. It cannot know your brand, your market context, your competitive dynamics, or your personal reasoning. That's what makes your assignment yours.

## What this skill covers

Brand growth strategy grounded in the Ehrenberg-Bass / Byron Sharp school:
- Why penetration drives growth (not loyalty)
- Double Jeopardy Law
- Mental and physical availability
- Category Entry Points (CEPs)
- Light buyers and reach strategy
- Growth myths (loyalty programmes, niche targeting, heavy user focus)

---

## Before you open the skill

Answer these questions yourself first — on paper, without AI:

1. What is the brand's current market share and penetration rate? (estimate if needed)
2. Who are the light buyers — people who buy the brand once or twice a year? What do you know about them?
3. What situations or moments trigger purchase in this category? Does the brand come to mind in all of them?
4. What growth strategy is the brand currently pursuing? Is it penetration-led or loyalty-led?
5. What does Byron Sharp's model predict should happen if the brand keeps its current strategy?

If you can't answer these without the AI, do primary or secondary research first.

## Suggested workflow

1. Draft your own growth diagnosis — what is working, what is not, what is the root cause
2. Use the skill in **learn mode**: submit your diagnosis and ask it to challenge you
3. Use the skill in **diagnose mode** to check your analysis against the frameworks
4. Revise your diagnosis based on what the skill surfaces
5. Use **strategy mode** to pressure-test your recommendations
6. Write your assignment — cite the academic sources, not the AI's output

---

## What the skill will probe you on (learn mode)

- Is your growth strategy based on penetration or loyalty? Why?
- Have you applied Double Jeopardy correctly?
- Are you targeting light buyers or only heavy users?
- What CEPs does the brand own — and which are gaps?
- Is your recommended advertising strategy reaching enough of the right category buyers?

---

## What your examiner will ask

- "Why is penetration more important than loyalty for this brand?"
- "What does the Double Jeopardy Law predict for a brand of this size in this category?"
- "Which CEPs are currently unaddressed — and what is the cost of that gap?"
- "Cite the evidence from Sharp / Ehrenberg-Bass that supports your recommendation."
- "What conventional marketing wisdom are you rejecting — and why does the evidence support that?"

---

## Academic integrity note

The skill contains the frameworks. Writing your assignment directly from skill output is equivalent to copying from a textbook without engagement. Your examiner is assessing your ability to:
- Apply frameworks to a specific, real brand context
- Make and defend strategic choices
- Cite original sources (Sharp, Romaniuk, Ehrenberg-Bass papers) — not the skill's synthesis

**Use the skill to sharpen your thinking. The thinking itself must be yours.**
