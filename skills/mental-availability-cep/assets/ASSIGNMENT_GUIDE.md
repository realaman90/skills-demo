# ASSIGNMENT GUIDE: Mental Availability & Category Entry Points

## Your role vs. the AI's role

**You** map the brand's reality. **The skill** applies the framework.

The skill knows the CEP framework and the mental availability research. It does not know which specific buying situations matter in your category, what your brand's associations are in consumers' minds, or how well your advertising currently builds salience. That is your research task.

## What this skill covers

- Mental availability: the propensity to be thought of in buying situations
- Category Entry Points (CEPs): the specific situations, triggers, and needs that cue brand retrieval
- Salience vs. differentiation: why being thought of often beats being thought of differently
- B2B CEPs and how they differ from consumer CEPs
- Measurement: how to audit CEP coverage
- Tactics: how advertising builds mental availability

## Before you open the skill

Do this yourself first:

1. List 6–8 situations in which a buyer in your category might think about purchasing. Be specific — not "when they need it" but "when they run out at home" or "when a colleague recommends it" or "when they see a competitor's ad."
2. For each situation: does your brand come to mind? What makes you think so?
3. Which situations does your brand "own"? Which do competitors own?
4. How does your brand's advertising currently link the brand to buying situations — or does it not?
5. What evidence (consumer research, tracking data) supports your CEP map?

---

## Suggested workflow

1. Build your CEP map independently — minimum 6 entry points
2. Use the skill in **learn mode**: share your map and ask it to probe gaps and assumptions
3. Use **audit mode** to formally evaluate coverage
4. Use **strategy mode** to get framework-grounded recommendations
5. Write your assignment citing Romaniuk, Sharp, and the source papers — not the AI output

## What the skill will probe you on (learn mode)

- Are your CEPs specific enough, or are they generic descriptions of "need"?
- What evidence do you have that the brand is actually linked to each CEP in buyers' minds?
- Are you confusing salience with differentiation?
- Which CEPs are over-served (too many brands) vs. under-served (opportunity)?
- How does your media and creative strategy currently address each CEP?

---

## What your examiner will ask

- "What is mental availability and why does it matter more than differentiation in low-involvement categories?"
- "Map at least 5 CEPs for this category. Which does the brand own and which are gaps?"
- "Cite Romaniuk's research to support your CEP strategy recommendation."
- "How would you measure whether this brand's mental availability is improving?"
- "What's the difference between being salient and being differentiated? Which is this brand?"

## Academic integrity note

The CEP map in your assignment must be built from category knowledge, consumer insight, or research — not from the AI. The skill can help you refine it, but cannot build it for you. Your examiner is assessing your ability to observe and analyse a real market, not your ability to reproduce a framework definition.
