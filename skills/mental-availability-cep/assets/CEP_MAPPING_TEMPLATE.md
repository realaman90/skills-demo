## Step 1: CEP Inventory
List all buying situations (CEPs) identified for this category:

| # | CEP Description | Type (Functional/Emotional/Social/Temporal) | Estimated Volume (H/M/L) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
| 4 | | | |
| 5 | | | |
| 6 | | | |
| 7 | | | |
| 8 | | | |

## Step 2: Competitive CEP Ownership Map
For each CEP, record which brands come to mind (from survey data or estimation):

| CEP | Our Brand | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C | Unclaimed? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | |
| 6 | | | | | |
| 7 | | | | | |
| 8 | | | | | |

Ownership scale: Strong (>30% mention) / Moderate (10–30%) / Weak (<10%) / Absent (0%)

## Step 3: Mental Availability Metrics

| Metric | Our Brand | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|---|---|---|---|
| CEP Breadth (# of CEPs with any link) | | | |
| Mental Market Share (%) | | | |
| Average Strength per CEP (%) | | | |

## Step 4: B2B Buying Committee (if applicable)

| Stakeholder Role | Key CEPs for This Role | Our Brand Linkage | Priority CEP to Own |
|---|---|---|---|
| CFO / Finance | | | |
| IT / CTO | | | |
| Operations | | | |
| End User | | | |
| Procurement | | | |

## Step 5: Gap Analysis & Priorities

**High-volume CEPs we are absent from:**
1. ___
2. ___

**High-volume CEPs we are weak in (competitors stronger):**
1. ___
2. ___

**High-volume CEPs that are unclaimed — opportunity:**
1. ___
2. ___

## Step 6: Campaign Recommendations
Based on CEP gaps above, recommend advertising campaigns to build linkages:

| CEP to Target | Campaign Concept | Channel | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |
| | | | |

Mental Availability Checklist:
- [ ] CEPs identified using buyer language (not brand attributes)
- [ ] CEPs volume-weighted (high vs. low frequency buying situations)
- [ ] Competitive ownership mapped per CEP
- [ ] B2B buying committee CEPs mapped by role (if applicable)
- [ ] Mental availability metrics calculated (breadth, share of mind)
- [ ] Gap analysis identifies high-priority CEPs to target
- [ ] Campaign recommendations linked to specific CEPs
