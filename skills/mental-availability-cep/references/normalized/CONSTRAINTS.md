# CONSTRAINTS

## What Does NOT Build Mental Availability (Myths and Constraints)

### Myth: Brand Differentiation Builds Salience
- **Reality**: Perceived differentiation has weak empirical correlation with mental availability or market share growth.
- Buyers do not carefully compare brand attributes in most buying situations — they retrieve the most salient option.
- A brand can have zero perceived differentiation and still have high mental availability and market share.
- **Constraint**: Do not prescribe "find a unique positioning" as the primary solution to low mental availability.

### Myth: Emotional Storytelling Alone Builds CEP Linkages
- **Reality**: Emotional advertising without clear brand-CEP connection builds brand warmth but not retrieval probability.
- Buyers must be able to connect the emotional story to both the brand (via DBAs) AND a buying situation (CEP).
- Advertising that is memorable but not linked to a buying situation fails to build mental availability.
- **Constraint**: Ensure all creative — even emotional — contains both brand identification (DBAs) and situational context (CEPs).

### Myth: Targeted Digital Advertising Builds Mental Availability
- **Reality**: Hyper-targeted digital advertising reaches a narrow audience repeatedly — high frequency, low reach.
- Mental availability requires reaching many people (broad reach) to build CEP linkages across the buyer population.
- Retargeting existing site visitors builds frequency among already-aware buyers, not breadth among new buyers.
- **Constraint**: Do not rely on narrow audience targeting as the primary mental availability strategy. Broad reach is required.

### Myth: Brand Purpose / Values Build Mental Availability
- **Reality**: Brand purpose communication may build positive attitudes but does not necessarily build CEP linkages.
- Buyers don't retrieve brands at purchase because of brand values — they retrieve brands that are salient in the CEP.
- **Constraint**: Purpose-led communication should always be connected to a buying situation (CEP) to contribute to mental availability.

### Myth: Customer Satisfaction Drives Mental Availability
- **Reality**: Satisfied customers are more likely to repurchase — but satisfaction does not generate new CEP linkages in non-buyers' minds.
- Non-buyers and light buyers (the growth audience) are not influenced by existing customer satisfaction.
- **Constraint**: Investment in NPS/satisfaction improvement is a retention tool, not a mental availability tool.

### Myth: More CEP Depth (Owning One CEP Completely) Is Always Better
- **Reality**: For most brands, breadth of CEP coverage is more valuable than dominating a single CEP.
- Dominating a single CEP limits brand relevance to one buying occasion — other occasions remain uncaptured.
- **Constraint**: Resist strategies that sacrifice CEP breadth to "own" a niche buying situation, unless the brand is deliberately niche.

### What CAN Be Promised (Within Evidence)
- Increasing advertising reach to category buyers will improve mental availability — this is the most reliable lever.
- Building CEP linkages in advertising (showing brand in buying situations) improves CEP-based retrieval.
- Consistent use of Distinctive Brand Assets improves the brand-CEP memory network.
- CEP survey measurement reliably tracks shifts in mental availability over time.
