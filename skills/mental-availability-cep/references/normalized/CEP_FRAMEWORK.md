# CEP_FRAMEWORK

## Category Entry Points (CEPs) — Core Framework

### What Are Category Entry Points?
- CEPs are the buying situations, motivations, goals, moods, and contexts that prompt a person to consider purchasing from a category.
- They are the "hooks" in a buyer's mind that trigger category consideration — and therefore brand retrieval.
- Examples (food):
  - "I need a quick weekday lunch"
  - "I want to treat myself after a hard day"
  - "I'm hosting a dinner party"
  - "I need something healthy for the kids"
- Examples (B2B software):
  - "We need to reduce operational costs"
  - "We're facing a compliance deadline"
  - "We're moving to the cloud"
  - "The CFO wants better visibility into spend"

### Why CEPs Matter for Brand Growth
- Buyers don't enter categories thinking "which brand do I prefer?" — they think "I need X" (the CEP).
- The brand that is linked to the CEP in memory is the one that gets retrieved and considered.
- Brands with more CEP linkages are considered in more buying situations = higher mental availability.

### How to Identify CEPs for a Category
Step 1 — Situation audit: When and why do buyers enter the category?
  - What task, goal, or need triggers the purchase?
  - What time of day / week / season?
  - What emotional state (celebratory, stressed, time-poor, health-conscious)?
  - Who else is involved (alone, with family, for work, for a client)?

Step 2 — Volume weighting: Not all CEPs are equal.
  - High-volume CEPs (common, frequent) offer more opportunity.
  - Niche CEPs (rare, specific) offer less penetration potential but may be useful for specialised brands.
  - Prioritise advertising that builds linkages to the top 5–8 CEPs by volume.

Step 3 — Competitive mapping: Who owns each CEP?
  - Survey which brands buyers associate with each CEP.
  - Identify CEPs the brand owns strongly, weakly, or not at all.
  - Identify CEPs dominated by competitors.

Step 4 — Gap analysis:
  - Which high-volume CEPs are weakly linked to the brand?
  - Which CEPs are unclaimed or contested — opportunity to build ownership?

### CEP Types
- **Functional CEPs**: Task-driven needs ("I need to get this done quickly", "I need to reduce costs").
- **Emotional CEPs**: Feeling-driven needs ("I want to feel rewarded", "I want to feel secure", "I want to impress").
- **Social CEPs**: Social context needs ("For a night out with friends", "For a client presentation").
- **Temporal CEPs**: Time-linked needs ("Monday morning", "End-of-quarter push", "Holiday season").

### CEP Breadth vs. Depth Trade-off
- **Breadth strategy**: Link the brand to many CEPs — maximises the number of buying situations where the brand is retrieved.
- **Depth strategy**: Build very strong links to fewer CEPs — maximises retrieval probability in those situations.
- Evidence favours **breadth** for large brands seeking penetration growth; depth may be appropriate for specialist/niche brands.

### Advertising and CEPs
- Effective advertising shows the brand in or near a CEP — it teaches buyers "when you're in this situation, think of this brand."
- CEP linkages must be regularly refreshed — they decay without continued advertising.
- Each ad doesn't need to cover all CEPs; a portfolio of communications covering multiple CEPs over time builds breadth.
