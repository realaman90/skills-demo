## Romaniuk_Sharp_Salience.pdf
- Original doc: docs/newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/Romaniuk_Sharp_Salience.pdf
- Known core claims:
  - "Mental availability is the probability that a buyer will notice or think of a brand in buying situations." (from: docs/newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/Romaniuk_Sharp_Salience.pdf)
  - "Brands are stored in memory as networks of associations linked to Category Entry Points — the situations that trigger category purchase." (from: docs/newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/Romaniuk_Sharp_Salience.pdf)
  - "Breadth of CEP coverage is a key determinant of mental availability — brands linked to more CEPs are more available in more buying situations." (from: docs/newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/Romaniuk_Sharp_Salience.pdf)
  - "Top-of-mind awareness is a narrower measure than mental availability — it captures only the first brand recalled, not the full scope of CEP-based retrieval." (from: docs/newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/Romaniuk_Sharp_Salience.pdf)

## Differentiation or Salience.pdf
- Original doc: docs/newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/Differentiation or Salience.pdf
- Known core claims:
  - "Salience — being easily noticed and thought of — outperforms perceived differentiation as a predictor of brand choice and market share." (from: docs/newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/Differentiation or Salience.pdf)
  - "A brand does not need to be perceived as different to be chosen — it needs to be salient in the relevant buying situation." (from: docs/newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/Differentiation or Salience.pdf)

## Romaniuk_b2bi-cepinb2b-final.pdf
- Original doc: docs/newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/Romaniuk_b2bi-cepinb2b-final.pdf
- Known core claims:
  - "B2B brands must build mental availability among all members of the buying committee — different roles have different Category Entry Points." (from: docs/newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/Romaniuk_b2bi-cepinb2b-final.pdf)
  - "A B2B brand not thought of cannot be shortlisted — mental availability is the prerequisite to B2B consideration." (from: docs/newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/Romaniuk_b2bi-cepinb2b-final.pdf)
  - "Account-based marketing reaches known contacts but does not build mental availability among new decision-makers — broad reach advertising is also required." (from: docs/newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/Romaniuk_b2bi-cepinb2b-final.pdf)

## romaniuk-et-al-2007-evidence-concerning-the-importance-of-perceived-brand-differentiation.pdf
- Original doc: docs/romaniuk-et-al-2007-evidence-concerning-the-importance-of-perceived-brand-differentiation (1).pdf
- Known core claims:
  - "Perceived brand differentiation is weakly and inconsistently correlated with brand performance metrics." (from: docs/romaniuk-et-al-2007-evidence-concerning-the-importance-of-perceived-brand-differentiation (1).pdf)
  - "High market share brands are not typically perceived as more different — they are simply more salient." (from: docs/romaniuk-et-al-2007-evidence-concerning-the-importance-of-perceived-brand-differentiation (1).pdf)

## Ritson_In the battle between salience and differentiation.pdf
- Original doc: docs/Ritson_In the battle between salience and differentiation.pdf
- Known core claims:
  - "Most brands over-invest in differentiation strategy and under-invest in reach and salience building." (from: docs/Ritson_In the battle between salience and differentiation.pdf)
  - "Salience and differentiation are not mutually exclusive, but salience is the more reliable lever for most brands in most categories." (from: docs/Ritson_In the battle between salience and differentiation.pdf)
