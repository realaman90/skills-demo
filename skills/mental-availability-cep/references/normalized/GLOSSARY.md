# GLOSSARY

## Mental Availability & CEP Terminology

### Mental Availability
The probability that a buyer will notice, recognise, or think of a brand when entering a category buying situation. A memory-based concept. Coined and developed by Byron Sharp and Jenni Romaniuk at the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute.

### Category Entry Point (CEP)
A buying situation, motivation, goal, mood, or context that triggers consideration of purchasing from a category. CEPs are the "hooks" that activate brand retrieval from memory. Different from brand attributes — CEPs describe the buyer's situation, not the brand's features.

### Memory Structure
The network of associations stored in a buyer's long-term memory that links a brand to Category Entry Points, Distinctive Brand Assets, and emotional contexts. Advertising builds and refreshes memory structures.

### Mental Market Share
A brand's share of total brand mentions across all CEP-based survey responses. A holistic measure of mental availability relative to competitors.

### CEP Breadth
The number of distinct Category Entry Points for which a brand is mentioned by at least one respondent. High breadth = the brand is linked to many buying situations.

### CEP Strength
The proportion of respondents who mention the brand for a specific CEP. High strength on a CEP = the brand is strongly associated with that buying situation.

### Salience
The propensity of a brand to be noticed or thought of in relevant contexts. Mental availability is the memory dimension of salience; physical availability is the in-market dimension.

### Differentiation (traditional marketing)
The strategy of being perceived as meaningfully better or different from competitors on attributes buyers value. Empirically, perceived differentiation is weakly correlated with brand growth — see Romaniuk et al. 2007.

### Distinctiveness (Ehrenberg-Bass)
Being easily recognisable as the brand — through Distinctive Brand Assets — rather than being perceived as functionally different. Distinctiveness builds salience; it does not require claimed attribute superiority.

### Distinctive Brand Assets (DBAs)
Non-name brand cues (colours, logos, shapes, jingles, taglines, mascots) that consistently and uniquely trigger brand recognition and retrieval. Measured on Fame and Uniqueness dimensions.

### Network Size
The total number of CEPs linked to a brand across all respondents in a mental availability survey. A broad indicator of how widely the brand's memory network spans buying situations.

### Share of Mind
The brand's proportion of total brand mentions relative to all brands in the category, measured across a set of CEPs.

### Top-of-Mind Awareness (TOMA)
The first brand recalled when buyers are asked "which brands come to mind in this category?" A narrower and less precise measure than CEP-based mental availability.

### Buying Committee (B2B)
The group of stakeholders involved in a B2B purchase decision. Different committee members (CFO, IT lead, Operations, Procurement, End Users) have different CEPs and may recall different brands.

### Physical Salience
The ease with which a brand is noticed at the point of purchase (shelf, online store, search results). Distinct from mental salience (memory retrieval) but complementary to it.

### Ehrenberg-Bass Institute
A marketing science research institute at the University of South Australia. Founded by Byron Sharp and Jenni Romaniuk, among others. Produces evidence-based marketing research on brand growth, CEPs, mental availability, and the NBD-Dirichlet model.
