## Evidence-Based Tactics to Build Mental Availability

### 1. Advertise to All Category Buyers — Not Just Your Customers
- Mental availability is built by reaching everyone who might ever buy from the category.
- Over-targeting existing customers maintains awareness among the already-converted — it does not expand CEP linkages.
- Use broad reach media (TV, radio, broad digital, programmatic, trade publications) to reach light buyers and non-buyers.

### 2. Link the Brand to Multiple CEPs in Every Campaign
- Each piece of advertising is an opportunity to refresh or build a brand-CEP memory link.
- Show the brand being used in, or associated with, specific buying situations (CEPs).
- Avoid abstract brand messaging that doesn't connect to any specific buying occasion.
- Over time, a portfolio of campaigns should cover the top 5–10 CEPs in the category.

### 3. Use Distinctive Brand Assets in Every Communication
- DBAs (colours, logos, characters, sounds, taglines) trigger brand retrieval from memory.
- Consistent use of DBAs across all CEP-linked communications strengthens the brand-CEP-DBA memory network.
- Without DBAs, advertising may build CEP associations without successfully linking them to the brand.

### 4. Maintain Advertising Continuity
- Memory links weaken without reinforcement — brands must advertise continuously, even at low weight.
- A continuous low-spend presence outperforms burst campaigns followed by silence for mental availability maintenance.
- Set a minimum base level of advertising spend that maintains CEP linkages in the market.

### 5. Prioritise Breadth Before Depth
- Build linkages to the most buying situations (breadth) before trying to "own" any single CEP deeply (depth).
- This is especially important for brands with low mental availability — get in more minds before trying to dominate any single CEP.
- Exception: if competitors completely own several CEPs, a depth strategy on contested-but-winnable CEPs may be appropriate.

### 6. Use Context-Rich Creative
- Creative that places the brand in a recognisable buying situation works better for CEP linkage than abstract brand imagery.
- Show real-life situations buyers recognise as their own CEPs.
- Emotional resonance in the CEP context strengthens the memory link.

### 7. For B2B: Build Mental Availability Across the Buying Committee
- Run awareness campaigns targeting all stakeholder roles — not just the primary contact.
- Create role-specific content (CFO-focused, IT-focused, Operations-focused) linked to their relevant CEPs.
- Use LinkedIn targeting by job function, industry events, and trade press to reach each committee role.

### 8. Leverage Salience at Point of Purchase
- Physical salience (being noticed at shelf or online) complements mental availability.
- Use distinctive packaging and strong in-store presence to trigger retrieval in the buying moment.
- For digital: optimise for brand visibility in search results, comparison sites, and marketplaces.

### 9. Measure CEP Coverage Regularly
- Run biannual or annual CEP-based mental availability surveys to track coverage and strength.
- Monitor shifts in competitive CEP ownership — competitors' advertising changes the landscape.
- Adjust campaign portfolio to address gaps in CEP coverage revealed by measurement.
