### The Mental Availability Survey Method
Romaniuk developed a survey-based method to measure mental availability across CEPs:

**Step 1 — Identify the CEP set**
- List 10–20 representative CEPs for the category.
- Include both high-volume and niche CEPs.
- Use consumer language, not brand or product language.

**Step 2 — Run the survey**
- For each CEP, ask respondents: "Which brands come to mind when you think of [CEP]?"
- Record first mention and all mentions (not just top-of-mind).
- Do not prompt with brand names — this is an unaided task.

**Step 3 — Calculate Mental Availability metrics**

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Network Size** | Number of unique CEPs the brand is linked to across all respondents |
| **Mental Market Share** | % of brand mentions across all CEP-responses (vs. total mentions for all brands) |
| **Breadth** | % of CEPs where the brand receives at least one mention |
| **Strength per CEP** | % of respondents who mention the brand for a specific CEP |
| **Share of Mind** | Brand mentions / total mentions across the CEP set |

**Step 4 — Benchmark against competitors**
- Compare breadth and strength metrics for all major brands in the category.
- Brands with broader coverage and higher mental market share have greater mental availability.

### Key Mental Availability Metrics — What They Tell You

**High Breadth, Low Strength per CEP**
- The brand is linked to many CEPs but not strongly owned on any.
- Typical of large brands — they appear across many situations but rarely dominate.
- Strategy: maintain broad coverage; selectively strengthen high-priority CEPs.

**Low Breadth, High Strength on Few CEPs**
- The brand is a specialist — strongly linked to a narrow set of CEPs.
- Typical of niche or new brands.
- Strategy: grow by expanding to adjacent CEPs without losing existing strengths.

**Low Breadth AND Low Strength**
- The brand has very low mental availability — buyers rarely retrieve it.
- Growth is severely constrained by lack of mental availability.
- Strategy: invest in reach-based advertising to build basic CEP linkages.

### Other Salience Metrics (Complementary)
- **Unaided brand awareness**: Simple "which brands have you heard of?" — useful baseline but less precise than CEP-based measurement.
- **Prompted recall in situation**: "When you need X [CEP], does [Brand] come to mind?" — measures specific CEP linkage.
- **Net Mental Advantage**: Difference between brand's mental market share and its actual market share — a diagnostic for under- or over-performing mental availability.

### Common Measurement Mistakes
- **Measuring only top-of-mind awareness**: Misses brands that are recalled later — underestimates mental availability.
- **Using prompted awareness**: Inflates apparent awareness; does not reflect genuine recall in buying situations.
- **Single generic awareness question**: "Are you aware of [Brand]?" — does not capture CEP-specific retrieval.
- **Ignoring light buyers in sample**: Sample should include non-buyers and light buyers — they are the growth audience.
- **Measuring satisfaction instead of salience**: Customer satisfaction does not predict mental availability or brand growth.

### Measuring B2B Mental Availability
- Run CEP surveys among all buying committee roles — not just senior decision-makers.
- Use role-specific CEPs: CFO CEPs are different from IT lead CEPs.
- Track mental market share by role and compare to competitor brands.
- Monitor change over time — mental availability shifts with advertising investment and competitive activity.
