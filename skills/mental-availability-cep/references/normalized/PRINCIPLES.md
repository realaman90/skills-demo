# PRINCIPLES

## Core Mental Availability Principles

### What Is Mental Availability?
- Mental availability is the probability that a buyer will think of a brand when entering a buying situation.
- It is a memory-based concept: brands compete to be retrieved from memory at the moment of purchase.
- High mental availability = the brand comes to mind easily across many different buying situations.
- Low mental availability = buyers simply don't think of the brand, even if they have no negative feelings toward it.

### Mental Availability Is a Network of Memory Associations
- Brands are stored in memory as networks of associations linking the brand to Category Entry Points (CEPs).
- The more CEPs a brand is linked to, the more buying situations in which it can be retrieved.
- The strength of each brand-CEP link determines how readily the brand is retrieved in that situation.
- Advertising works by building and refreshing these memory links — not by creating entirely new brand images.

### Mental Availability Requires Two Dimensions
1. **Breadth**: The number of CEPs the brand is linked to in memory (CEP coverage).
2. **Strength**: How strongly the brand is linked to each CEP (retrieval probability per CEP).
- Broad CEP coverage is more important than deep linkage to a few CEPs — broader reach = more buying situations where the brand can be retrieved.

### Mental Availability Decays Without Maintenance
- Memory links weaken over time without advertising reinforcement.
- Brands that go dark (stop advertising) lose mental availability — especially among light buyers and non-buyers.
- Continuous advertising at moderate reach is more effective than burst campaigns followed by silence.

### Mental Availability vs. Top-of-Mind Awareness
- Top-of-mind awareness (TOMA) is the single brand recalled first in an unaided awareness question.
- Mental availability is broader: it captures the probability of recall across all relevant CEPs, not just one generic "what brand comes to mind?" question.
- TOMA undercounts mental availability — a brand can have high availability in specific CEPs without being the first mentioned.

### Salience Is a Related But Distinct Concept
- Salience = propensity to be noticed or thought of in relevant contexts.
- Mental availability is the memory dimension of salience.
- Physical salience (being noticeable at point of purchase) is a separate but complementary dimension.
- Both must be managed to maximise the chance of brand choice.
