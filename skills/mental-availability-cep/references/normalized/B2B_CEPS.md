### Do the Same Laws Apply in B2B?
- Yes. Mental availability and CEPs work the same way in B2B as in consumer markets.
- B2B buyers also make decisions based on brands that come to mind in relevant buying situations.
- B2B brands with broader CEP coverage are more likely to be shortlisted.
- Being thought of in B2B is a prerequisite to being evaluated — mental availability precedes consideration.

### The Complexity of B2B Buying Committees
- B2B purchases typically involve multiple stakeholders — the buying committee.
- Different committee members have different CEPs:
  - **CFO / Finance**: cost reduction, ROI, budget cycles, financial risk, audit readiness.
  - **IT / CTO**: security, integration complexity, scalability, technical risk, cloud migration.
  - **Operations / COO**: efficiency, process improvement, reliability, downtime risk.
  - **End Users**: ease of use, support quality, workflow disruption, adoption speed.
  - **Procurement**: supplier risk, compliance, contractual terms, vendor consolidation.
- A B2B brand must build mental availability across ALL committee roles, not just the primary contact.

### Why B2B Mental Availability Is Often Neglected
- B2B marketing over-relies on account-based marketing (ABM) and relationship sales.
- ABM reaches known contacts — it does not build mental availability among non-buyers or new decision-makers.
- When a new CFO, IT lead, or CEO arrives at a prospect company, ABM cannot reach them — broad brand advertising can.

**Enterprise Software / SaaS:**
- "We need to reduce manual processes across the business"
- "The board wants a single source of truth for financials"
- "We're preparing for an audit and need better controls"
- "We're migrating to the cloud over the next 18 months"

- "We're acquiring another company and need due diligence support"
- "We need an external view on our strategy before the board meeting"

- "We experienced a security breach and need to upgrade"
- "We're scaling up headcount and need more capacity"
- "We want to reduce our energy and operational costs"

### How to Map B2B CEPs
1. **Interview / survey each buyer role**: What triggers you to start looking for a solution in this category?
2. **Identify committee-level CEPs**: Which CEPs are shared across roles? Which are role-specific?
3. **Prioritise by frequency and influence**: Which CEPs trigger the most purchase decisions? Which roles have the most influence?
4. **Map brand linkages**: For each CEP, which brand comes to mind first among each committee role?
5. **Identify gaps**: Which high-volume CEPs are unowned or weakly linked to our brand?

### B2B Mental Availability Building Tactics
- **Broad reach content**: LinkedIn thought leadership, industry event sponsorships, trade publication advertising — reaching all potential committee members.
- **Role-specific messaging**: Content tailored to each committee member's CEPs (CFO content for finance CEPs, IT content for technology CEPs).
- **Consistent Distinctive Brand Assets**: Ensure the brand is visually consistent and recognisable across all B2B touchpoints.
- **Category-level campaigns**: Advertising that educates the market about the problem (CEP) before proposing the solution — builds association between problem and brand.
- **Retargeting with role-specific creative**: Reach known contacts with CEP-relevant messaging based on their role.
