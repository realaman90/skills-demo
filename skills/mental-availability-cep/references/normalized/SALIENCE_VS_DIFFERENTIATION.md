### What Is Differentiation (in marketing theory)?
- Traditional positioning theory (Porter, Trout) argues brands must be meaningfully different from competitors on attributes buyers value.
- Differentiation = being perceived as distinctly better or different on functional or emotional attributes.
- Example: "We are the only B2B software with real-time AI anomaly detection" (functional differentiation).
- Traditional assumption: buyers evaluate differences and choose the superior brand.

### What Does the Evidence Say About Differentiation?
- Research by Romaniuk et al. found that perceived brand differentiation is weakly correlated with brand performance.
- Consumers hold very similar perceptions of competing brands — the "meaningful difference" marketers see is often imperceptible to buyers.
- High-share brands are not typically perceived as more different; they are simply more salient.
- Loyalty is not driven by perceived uniqueness — it is driven by purchase frequency (Dirichlet norms).

### What Is Salience and Why Does It Matter More?
- Salience is the propensity of a brand to come to mind (be noticed or recalled) in relevant situations.
- Salient brands are noticed at the shelf, recalled in buying situations, and considered without deliberate evaluation.
- Salience is driven by mental availability (memory links to CEPs) and physical availability (ease of finding).
- A salient brand does not need to be perceived as different — it just needs to be noticed and retrieved.

### Distinctiveness ≠ Differentiation
- **Differentiation**: "We are better/different on what matters."
- **Distinctiveness**: "We are easily recognisable as ourselves — our assets make us stand out and be identified."
- Distinctiveness (via Distinctive Brand Assets — colours, logos, jingles) drives salience.
- Differentiation (via claimed attribute superiority) has weak empirical support as a growth driver.
- A brand can be highly distinctive without being differentiated on functional attributes — and still grow.

### Ritson's Nuanced View
- Ritson argues that the salience vs. differentiation debate is a false binary — both matter, but for different purposes.
- Salience (mental availability) is necessary to be considered; some differentiation may help in the evaluation stage.
- However, even Ritson agrees that most brands over-invest in differentiation strategy and under-invest in reach and salience building.

### Practical Implications
| If the brand is… | Focus on… |
|---|---|
| Not being thought of in buying situations | Mental availability (CEP linkages, reach, salience) |
| Being thought of but not chosen | Physical availability + offer/product quality |
| Growing in a competitive market | Salience > Differentiation for penetration growth |
| Defending a premium price position | Some differentiation may help justify price premium |
| Launching a new product | Salience to build category awareness first |

### When Differentiation Can Still Matter
- Category choice (deciding to buy from the category) may be influenced by brand differentiation.
- In low-frequency, high-involvement categories (e.g., enterprise software, financial services, B2B procurement), buyers may spend more time evaluating differences.
- But even in these categories, the brand must first be mentally available to be evaluated at all.
