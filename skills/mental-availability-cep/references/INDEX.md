## Normalized Files
- normalized/PRINCIPLES.md — Core mental availability principles (definition, memory networks, breadth vs. strength, decay)
- normalized/CEP_FRAMEWORK.md — Category Entry Points framework (identification, types, mapping steps, breadth vs. depth)
- normalized/SALIENCE_VS_DIFFERENTIATION.md — Evidence-based debate: salience vs. differentiation (Romaniuk, Sharp, Ritson)
- normalized/B2B_CEPS.md — CEPs in B2B markets (buying committees, role-specific CEPs, building B2B mental availability)
- normalized/MEASUREMENT.md — Mental availability survey methodology, metrics, benchmarking
- normalized/TACTICS.md — Evidence-based tactics for building mental availability and CEP linkages
- normalized/CONSTRAINTS.md — What does NOT build mental availability (myths: differentiation, targeting, satisfaction)
- normalized/GLOSSARY.md — Mental availability and CEP terminology
- normalized/PDF_SUMMARIES.md — PDF source summaries with topics and OCR status
- normalized/SOURCE_QUOTES.md — Quote bank from source docs for citations

## Gaps
- Direct verbatim text extraction from PDFs is limited (scanned/academic PDFs). Enable OCR (ENABLE_OCR=1) for better extraction.
- Some PDFs appear in both docs/ root and newskills/02_Mental_Availability_CEP/ — treated as same content.
- Industry-specific CEP examples beyond those provided are available via web_search if needed.
