# ASSIGNMENT GUIDE: Brand-Based Business Development

## Your role vs. the AI's role

**You** evaluate the strategic opportunity. **The skill** applies the frameworks.

The skill knows Aaker's brand relevance model, the extension evaluation framework, Blue Ocean's ERRC grid, and portfolio architecture options. What it cannot assess is the specific commercial logic, competitive dynamics, and organisational constraints of your chosen brand's growth decision. That requires your analysis.

## What this skill covers

- Brand extensions: fit, leverage, and risk evaluation (Aaker & Keller)
- Brand relevance: subcategory creation and the exemplar strategy
- Portfolio management: branded house, house of brands, endorsed, hybrid architectures
- Blue Ocean Strategy: the ERRC framework and value innovation
- Line extensions: when they work and when they erode the brand

## Before you open the skill

Do this yourself first:

1. Identify the specific growth opportunity: what category or market is the brand considering entering (or has entered)?
2. Classify it independently: is this a line extension, brand extension, subcategory creation, blue ocean, or portfolio addition?
3. Assess fit on two dimensions: (a) product category fit — is this a related category? (b) brand concept fit — does the extension match the brand's personality and values?
4. Identify the biggest risk: could a failed extension damage the parent brand's equity? How?
5. Should the parent brand name be on this at all? Or does it need a sub-brand or new brand?

---

## Suggested workflow

1. Write your initial opportunity classification and fit/risk assessment independently
2. Use the skill in **learn mode**: share your assessment and ask it to challenge your classification and risk reasoning
3. Use **extension mode** to run the full fit/leverage/risk evaluation
4. Use **portfolio mode** to determine the right brand architecture
5. Use **blue-ocean mode** only if you believe this is genuinely a new market space — apply the ERRC grid
6. Write your assignment — cite Aaker (brand relevance), Keller (brand extensions), and Kim & Mauborgne (Blue Ocean) as appropriate

---

## What the skill will probe you on (learn mode)

- Is your classification correct? (Many "innovations" are actually line extensions)
- What is the leverage — how does the parent brand's equity actually help in the new category?
- What is the specific dilution risk to the parent brand if this extension underperforms?
- Does the brand architecture decision match the risk level of the extension?
- Is this genuinely a new subcategory, or is it just a variant?

---

## What your examiner will ask

- "Classify this growth opportunity. Justify your classification using the framework."
- "Score the extension on fit and risk. What does your score recommend — full extension, sub-brand, endorsed brand, or new brand?"
- "Apply Aaker's brand relevance model: is this brand at risk of becoming irrelevant in an emerging subcategory?"
- "If you chose Blue Ocean — complete the strategy canvas and ERRC grid. What is the new value curve?"
- "What is the cannibalisation risk, and how would you manage it?"

## Academic integrity note

The extension evaluation in your assignment must be based on real market data and competitive analysis — what competitors are doing, what consumers expect in the category, what the brand's actual equity is. The frameworks are tools for organising your analysis, not substitutes for it.
