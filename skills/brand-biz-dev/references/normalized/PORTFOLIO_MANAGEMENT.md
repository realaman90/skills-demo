### Why Brand Portfolio Management Matters
- Most companies operate multiple brands — the portfolio must be managed as a system, not as isolated brands.
- Portfolio mismanagement leads to: brand overlap, internal cannibalisation, resource dilution, consumer confusion.
- A well-managed portfolio creates: clear roles for each brand, efficient resource allocation, maximum market coverage with minimum overlap.

### The Four Portfolio Architecture Models

**1. Branded House**
- One master brand across all products and services.
- Sub-products use descriptors, not separate brand names.
- Example: Virgin (Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Media, Virgin Money — all "Virgin").
- Example: FedEx (FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Office).
- **Advantages**: All investment builds a single brand; strong brand equity benefits every offering; clear corporate identity.
- **Disadvantages**: One brand failure damages all; limits ability to target diverse segments; restricts brand personality flexibility.
- **Best for**: Brands with a strong, coherent identity applicable across all offerings.

**2. House of Brands**
- Each product or business operates under its own independent brand name.
- Parent company is invisible or minimally visible to consumers.
- Example: Procter & Gamble (Tide, Pampers, Gillette, Ariel — all separate brands).
- Example: LVMH (Louis Vuitton, Moët, Hennessy, Dior — independent brands).
- **Advantages**: Each brand optimised for its segment; one brand's crisis doesn't infect others; maximum targeting flexibility.
- **Disadvantages**: High investment required to build each brand; no equity sharing; inefficient at scale.
- **Best for**: Companies with highly diverse, incompatible audiences or categories.

**3. Endorsed Brand Architecture**
- Independent brands endorsed by a visible corporate master brand.
- Format: "[Sub-brand] by [Master Brand]" or "[Sub-brand], a [Master Brand] company."
- Example: Courtyard by Marriott, Polo by Ralph Lauren.
- **Advantages**: Sub-brands get credibility boost from master brand; master brand builds breadth; some separation if sub-brand fails.
- **Disadvantages**: Master brand endorsement creates some responsibility for sub-brand quality.
- **Best for**: Companies expanding into adjacent categories where master brand credibility helps but sub-brand distinction is needed.

**4. Hybrid / Mixed Architecture**
- Combination of branded house and house of brands in different parts of the portfolio.
- Example: Nestlé (Nestlé master brand on some products; Kit Kat, Nescafé, Milo as distinct brands).
- **Advantages**: Flexibility; optimised by category.
- **Disadvantages**: Complexity; requires strong portfolio governance to avoid confusion.

### Portfolio Role Assignment
Every brand in the portfolio should have an explicit role:

| Role | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Strategic Brand** | Core to the company's long-term direction and competitive position | IBM (consulting era) |
| **Drive Brand** | Primary driver of current revenue and profitability | Google Search |
| **Flanker Brand** | Protects a key brand from competitive attack at a price or niche level | Budget airline flanking full-service carrier |
| **Cash Cow Brand** | Mature brand generating profit without growth investment | Legacy product lines |
| **Incubator Brand** | New brand exploring an emerging category or segment | Experimental ventures |

### Portfolio Pruning
- Too many brands dilutes management attention and marketing investment.
- Brands below a minimum viability threshold should be: merged into a stronger brand, repositioned, or retired.
- Pruning decision criteria: revenue contribution, strategic fit, growth potential, cannibalisation of portfolio siblings.

### Managing Portfolio Cannibalisation
- Some cannibalisation is acceptable — it is better to cannibalise yourself than let a competitor do it.
- Problematic cannibalisation: when a lower-margin offering undercuts a higher-margin sibling without capturing new buyers.
- Manage through: price point separation, distinct value propositions, targeting different segments or occasions.
