### The Core Insight: Win by Creating Subcategories
- The most powerful brand growth strategy is not to be preferred over competitors — it is to make competitors irrelevant by defining a new subcategory.
- When a brand creates a new subcategory, it sets the standards. Competitors are evaluated against the brand's template, not their own.
- Consumers don't just prefer the brand — they see the old alternatives as no longer relevant to their needs.
- Examples: Red Bull (energy drinks didn't exist — Red Bull created the subcategory), Prius (eco-car subcategory), Salesforce (cloud CRM subcategory), Airbnb (home-sharing subcategory).

### Relevance vs. Preference — A Fundamental Distinction
| | Preference Competition | Relevance Competition |
|---|---|---|
| Goal | Be chosen over competitors | Make competitors irrelevant |
| Means | Better features, marketing, price | Create a new subcategory |
| Durability | Short-term — competitors respond | Long-term — subcategory owned |
| Risk | Always under threat from improvement | Requires genuine innovation |
| Winning metric | Market share in existing category | Subcategory definition and ownership |

### How Subcategories Are Created
A new subcategory requires a **must-have** — a feature, benefit, or experience that:
- Buyers care deeply about
- Defines a genuinely new way of meeting a need
- Competitors cannot easily replicate (or haven't yet)
- The pioneering brand can credibly own

The must-have becomes the entry barrier: to be relevant in the subcategory, competitors must match it. But the pioneering brand is always the reference point.

### Making the Subcategory Stick: Exemplar Brand Strategy
- The brand that creates the subcategory must become the **exemplar** — the brand that defines what the subcategory is.
- When buyers think of the subcategory, they should think of the brand first (and often exclusively).
- Exemplar status is built through: first-mover advantage, distinctive brand assets, consistent communication of the must-have, and continued innovation within the subcategory.

### Building Barriers After Subcategory Creation
Once the subcategory is created, build barriers to entry:
1. **Scale**: Grow fast to establish distribution and customer base before competitors arrive.
2. **Innovation pipeline**: Continuously improve the must-have — stay ahead of followers.
3. **Switching costs**: Build ecosystem lock-in (integrations, data, community, loyalty programmes).
4. **Distinctive Brand Assets**: Become visually and verbally synonymous with the subcategory.
5. **Category labels**: Own the language — if the brand name becomes the category name (Hoover, Xerox, Uber), that's exemplar dominance.

### Relevance Audit — Key Questions
- Is our brand relevant to buyers in the most important emerging subcategories?
- Are there subcategories forming where we are absent — making us irrelevant by default?
- What must-haves are buyers beginning to expect that we don't currently offer?
- Which emerging subcategories could we credibly create or lead?
- Are competitors creating subcategories that will make our current offering irrelevant?
