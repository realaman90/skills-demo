### The Core Idea: Create Uncontested Market Space
- Blue Ocean Strategy (Kim & Mauborgne) argues that sustainable growth comes from creating new market space ("blue oceans") rather than competing in existing markets ("red oceans").
- Red oceans: existing market spaces where competitors fight for share, margins erode, and growth is hard.
- Blue oceans: new market spaces with no direct competition — created through value innovation.
- A brand that creates a blue ocean is not just better than competitors — it makes the existing competitive frame irrelevant.
- Link to Aaker: Blue Ocean Strategy is the market creation mechanism; Brand Relevance is the brand strategy that makes the new space ownable.

### Value Innovation — The Engine of Blue Oceans
- Value innovation occurs when a company simultaneously pursues differentiation AND lower cost — creating a leap in value for buyers while reducing costs for the company.
- It breaks the conventional trade-off: "differentiation OR cost" → value innovation delivers "differentiation AND cost efficiency."
- Example: Cirque du Soleil eliminated expensive circus elements (animals, star performers) while raising the theatrical experience — simultaneously reducing cost and increasing buyer value.

### The Four Actions Framework (ERRC Grid)
To construct a new value curve that opens a blue ocean:

**Eliminate**: Which factors the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?
- These are factors that add cost but deliver little or no value to buyers.
- Eliminating them reduces cost and clears space for genuine innovation.

**Reduce**: Which factors should be reduced well below the industry standard?
- These are over-delivered factors — the industry invests more than buyers actually value.

**Raise**: Which factors should be raised well above the industry standard?
- Areas where the industry under-delivers on what buyers really want.

**Create**: Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?
- New sources of value that define the blue ocean and attract buyers from outside the current market.

### The Strategy Canvas
- The Strategy Canvas plots competing brands on key industry factors (x-axis) against the level of offering (y-axis).
- A brand's value curve = its profile across all factors on the canvas.
- Blue Ocean: a value curve that diverges significantly from competitors — with a clear, compelling focus.
- Red Ocean: value curves cluster together — brands offer similar things at similar levels.

### Blue Ocean Applied to Brand Strategy
- Identify: What factors does your category compete on? Plot the current value curve.
- Eliminate/Reduce: What category conventions can be dropped — freeing resources and simplifying the offer?
- Raise/Create: What genuinely new value can be introduced that makes current alternatives irrelevant?
- Brand the new space: Once the blue ocean is defined, the brand must claim and name the new subcategory (link to Aaker's exemplar brand strategy).

### Blue Ocean vs. Traditional Brand Extension
| | Brand Extension | Blue Ocean |
|---|---|---|
| Starting point | Existing brand equity | Buyer value — unconstrained |
| Scope | Adjacent categories | New market space |
| Competitive frame | Still competing with category incumbents | No direct competition |
| Brand role | Leverage existing identity | Pioneer and name the new space |
| Risk | Extension fit and dilution | Innovation and first-mover execution |

### When to Use Blue Ocean Thinking
- When the existing category is commoditising rapidly.
- When the brand has innovation capability but is stuck competing on shrinking margins.
- When there are significant non-consumers who don't buy from the category because no option meets their actual needs.
- When a disruptive competitor is about to enter with a radically different value proposition.
