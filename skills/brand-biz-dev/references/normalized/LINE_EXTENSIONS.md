### What Is a Line Extension?
- A line extension applies an existing brand name to a new variant within the same product category.
- Examples: Coca-Cola → Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Coke Vanilla; Nike → Nike Air, Nike Free, Nike Flyknit; iPhone → iPhone Pro, iPhone Mini.
- Line extensions are the most common form of brand-based growth — and the most frequently mismanaged.

### When Line Extensions Work
- **Meeting genuine segment needs**: A new variant that serves a meaningfully different need within the category (e.g., a sugar-free variant for health-conscious buyers).
- **Occasion coverage**: Extending to cover buying occasions the base product doesn't serve (e.g., a smaller pack size for on-the-go consumption).
- **Competitive response**: Matching a competitor's variant to prevent share loss.
- **Shelf presence**: Filling shelf space to block competitors in retail channels.
- **Premium tier within brand**: A "pro" or "premium" variant that trades buyers up within the brand.

### When Line Extensions Fail
- **Cannibalising the base without growing the category**: New variants steal sales from the core product — no net gain, but higher complexity.
- **Confusing the brand message**: Too many variants dilute the brand's clear promise.
- **Operational complexity**: More variants increase manufacturing, logistics, and retail management costs.
- **Retailers dropping variants**: Retailers manage shelf space tightly — low-performing variants get cut.
- **Diluting brand identity**: If extensions push the brand away from its core positioning, they erode the equity they're meant to leverage.

### The Line Extension Trap (Ries & Trout Warning)
- Ries & Trout argued that line extensions are the most common cause of brand positioning erosion.
- Each extension adds another meaning to the brand name — diluting the single, focused concept the brand should own.
- "Coke" once meant one thing. "New Coke", "Coke Classic", "Diet Coke" — each extension blurred the brand's mental position.
- The line extension trap: short-term sales gains from new variants at the cost of long-term brand clarity.

### Principles for Responsible Line Extension
1. **Start from buyer need, not product capability**: Only extend if there is a genuine, unfulfilled buyer need — not just because manufacturing can produce it.
2. **Set minimum viability thresholds**: Each extension must meet a minimum revenue/margin target — retire underperforming variants.
3. **Protect the core brand's positioning**: Extensions should reinforce or at least be neutral to the core brand's PODs and personality.
4. **Sub-brand if the extension is sufficiently different**: If the variant is genuinely distinct, use a sub-brand name to allow separate positioning.
5. **Manage the portfolio actively**: Review line extension performance annually — prune ruthlessly.

### Brand Concept Management and Extensions
Park, Jaworski & MacInnis (Brand Concept Management) argue that extensions should be consistent with the brand's core concept:
- **Functional brands**: Should extend to functionally related products (same use context or complementary function).
- **Symbolic brands**: Should extend to products that share symbolic meaning and user imagery.
- **Experiential brands**: Should extend to products that deliver the same type of experience.
Extending outside a brand's core concept type risks cognitive inconsistency — consumers reject extensions that don't "feel right."
