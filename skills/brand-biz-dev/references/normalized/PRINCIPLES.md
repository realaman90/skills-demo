### The Brand as a Business Growth Engine
- A strong brand is not just a marketing asset — it is a strategic business asset that can directly enable growth.
- Brand equity (awareness, associations, perceived quality, loyalty) can be leveraged to:
  - Enter new product categories (brand extensions)
  - Create new market spaces (subcategory creation)
  - Command price premiums
  - Attract and retain talent (employer brand)
  - Build partner and distribution relationships
  - Reduce customer acquisition costs through trust transfer

### Two Modes of Brand-Based Competition
1. **Preference Competition**: Competing to be preferred over rivals in an existing category.
   - Winning means being chosen over direct competitors.
   - Success metric: market share, purchase preference.
   - Risk: diminishing returns as categories commoditise; competitors can always improve.

2. **Relevance Competition**: Competing to define a new subcategory that others cannot enter.
   - Winning means making the old alternatives irrelevant — not just less preferred.
   - Success metric: subcategory ownership, first-mover lock-in.
   - Risk: requires genuine innovation; cannot be faked with marketing alone.

### Brand Equity as a Platform for Growth
- Brand equity reduces the risk of new launches — consumers extend trust from the known brand to the new offering.
- Brand equity enables premium pricing in new categories — strong brands command margin even in competitive markets.
- Brand equity accelerates distribution — retailers and partners are more willing to take on extensions from strong brands.
- Brand equity must be actively protected during growth — every extension either deposits into or withdraws from the brand equity account.

### De Chernatony's Corporate Brand Perspective
- The corporate brand is itself a business development tool — it signals capability, culture, and values to all stakeholders.
- Corporate brand clarity enables: talent acquisition, investor confidence, partner credibility, customer trust.
- Internal brand alignment is essential — employees must live the brand for it to be credible externally.

### Growth Strategy Hierarchy
1. **Penetration in existing markets** with existing brands (lowest risk — see `brand-growth` skill).
2. **Line extensions** — new variants in existing categories with existing brand (moderate risk).
3. **Brand extensions** — existing brand into new categories (higher risk; requires fit assessment).
4. **New brands in existing markets** — new brand to serve a different segment (high investment).
5. **New brands in new markets** — highest risk; requires full brand building from scratch.
- Brand-based business development focuses on options 2, 3, and the strategic use of existing brand equity.
