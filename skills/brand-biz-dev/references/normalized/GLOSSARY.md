# GLOSSARY

## Brand-Based Business Development Terminology

### Brand Extension
Applying an established brand name to a new product in a different product category. Leverages parent brand equity to reduce launch costs and build initial trust in the new category.

### Line Extension
Applying an existing brand name to a new variant within the same product category (new flavour, size, formulation, tier). Most common — and most frequently mismanaged — form of brand-based growth.

### Brand Relevance
Aaker's concept: a brand is relevant when buyers consider it a viable option in a category or subcategory. Relevance is the prerequisite for preference — an irrelevant brand cannot be chosen regardless of quality.

### Relevance Competition
Competing by creating a new subcategory that others cannot easily enter, making existing alternatives irrelevant. Contrasted with preference competition (competing to be chosen over existing rivals).

### Preference Competition
Competing to be preferred over direct rivals in an established category. Susceptible to competitive response — a rival can always improve to close the preference gap.

### Subcategory Creation
Defining a new market segment or product category anchored by a must-have innovation. The pioneering brand becomes the exemplar and defines what the subcategory is.

### Exemplar Brand
The brand that defines a subcategory — when buyers think of the subcategory, they think of this brand first. Exemplar status is the highest form of brand relevance.

### Must-Have (Subcategory)
The feature, benefit, or experience that defines a new subcategory and creates an entry barrier. Buyers must have it to consider any option in the subcategory relevant; competitors must match it to participate.

### Brand Portfolio
The complete set of brands owned and managed by a company. Requires active management to define roles, prevent cannibalisation, and allocate resources efficiently.

### Branded House
Portfolio architecture where one master brand spans all products and services. Sub-products use descriptors, not separate brand names. Example: Virgin, FedEx.

### House of Brands
Portfolio architecture where each product operates under an independent brand name. Parent company invisible or minimally visible. Example: P&G (Tide, Pampers, Gillette).

### Endorsed Brand Architecture
Portfolio architecture where independent sub-brands are visibly endorsed by a master brand. Format: "[Sub-brand] by [Master Brand]." Example: Courtyard by Marriott.

### Blue Ocean Strategy
Kim & Mauborgne's strategy of creating uncontested new market space through value innovation — simultaneously achieving differentiation and lower cost. Contrasted with red ocean (existing competitive) markets.

### Value Innovation
The strategic logic of Blue Ocean Strategy: creating a leap in buyer value while simultaneously reducing cost — breaking the differentiation-vs-cost trade-off.

### Four Actions Framework (ERRC)
Blue Ocean tool: Eliminate (factors to drop), Reduce (factors to deliver below industry standard), Raise (factors to deliver above industry standard), Create (new factors never offered). Used to build a new value curve.

### Strategy Canvas
Blue Ocean visual tool: plots brands on key industry factors (x-axis) vs. level of offering (y-axis). Shows value curves for all competitors — identifies differentiation and blue ocean opportunities.

### Brand Concept Management
Park, Jaworski & MacInnis framework: brands are built around functional, symbolic, or experiential concepts — and extensions must be consistent with the parent brand's core concept type.

### Cannibalisation
When a new brand extension, line extension, or portfolio addition takes sales from an existing brand in the same portfolio rather than growing the total market. Some level is acceptable; structural cannibalisation of higher-margin products by lower-margin extensions is not.
