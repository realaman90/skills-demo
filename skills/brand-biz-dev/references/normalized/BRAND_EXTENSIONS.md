### What Is a Brand Extension?
- A brand extension occurs when an established brand name is applied to a new product in a different category.
- It leverages existing brand equity (awareness, trust, associations) to reduce launch costs and risk in the new category.
- Examples: Virgin (music → airlines → financial services → health clubs), Apple (computers → music players → phones → watches), Dove (soap → shampoo → body wash → skincare).

### The Aaker & Keller Brand Extension Evaluation Framework
Three factors determine whether a brand extension will succeed:

**1. Fit (Brand-Extension Congruence)**
- Does the extension make sense given the parent brand's identity and associations?
- Fit operates on two dimensions:
  - **Product category fit**: Are the categories related in consumers' minds? (shared attributes, usage occasions, or manufacturing process)
  - **Brand concept fit**: Does the extension match the brand's personality, values, and image?
- High fit → lower consumer resistance, higher initial trust, easier adoption.
- Low fit → confusion, scepticism, or damage to the parent brand's clarity.

**2. Leverage (Equity Transfer)**
- Does the parent brand's equity actually help in the new category?
- Leverage depends on: whether parent brand associations (quality, expertise, values) are relevant to the new category's purchase decision.
- High leverage: A luxury fashion brand extending to fragrances — prestige associations transfer directly.
- Low leverage: A luxury fashion brand extending to financial services — prestige associations are peripheral to financial decision criteria.

**3. Extension Risk**
- Does the extension risk damaging the parent brand's clarity, reputation, or positioning?
- Risk is highest when: the extension fails in market, the extension contradicts parent brand values, or the extension dilutes a focused brand position.
- Risk is moderated by: portfolio architecture choices (sub-branding, endorsed brands), market separation, and the brand's breadth of existing associations.

### The Extension Decision Matrix

| Fit | Leverage | Risk | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| High | High | Low | Strong extension opportunity — proceed |
| High | High | Medium | Proceed with sub-branding to protect parent |
| High | Low | Low | Extension possible but build-specific credibility needed |
| Low | High | Medium | Proceed only with strong endorsed architecture |
| Low | Low | High | Do not extend — create a new brand |

### Sub-Branding as Risk Mitigation
- Sub-branding creates a new brand that is linked to but distinct from the parent brand.
- Format: "[Parent Brand] [Descriptor]" — e.g., "Apple Watch", "Marriott Courtyard", "Nike Air".
- Sub-branding allows: extension into adjacent categories, targeting new segments, while protecting parent brand focus.
- Trade-off: sub-brands build their own equity more slowly than pure extensions — requires more investment.

### Vertical Extensions (Up/Down Market)
- **Step-up extension**: Existing brand moves upmarket (premium tier).
  - Risk: existing customers feel alienated; premium tier may lack credibility.
- **Step-down extension**: Existing brand moves downmarket (value tier).
  - Risk: premium brand diluted; existing premium customers defect.
- Both vertical extensions require careful sub-branding or separate brand names to manage perception risks.

### Consumer Evaluation Process for Extensions
Consumers evaluate extensions using:
1. They retrieve the parent brand's associations.
2. They assess whether those associations transfer to the extension category.
3. If fit is perceived: they form a positive initial attitude based on parent brand equity.
4. If fit is not perceived: they evaluate the extension more like a new brand — requiring proof of capability.
5. After experience with the extension: perceptions update (positively or negatively) and may feed back to the parent brand.
