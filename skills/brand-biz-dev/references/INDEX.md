## Gaps
- Verbatim PDF text extraction is limited. Enable OCR (ENABLE_OCR=1) for better extraction.
- Brand Concept Management (Park, Jaworski & MacInnis) full three-stage model detail available in source PDF.
- De Chernatony's full internal brand alignment methodology has additional depth in source PDF.
