## Key Frameworks

1. **Employer Brand / EVP** (Ambler & Barrow): Functional + Economic + Psychological benefits
2. **Corporate Associations** (Brown & Dacin): CA (capability) + CSR (character)
3. **RepTrak** (Ponzi et al.): Pulse (4 emotional items) + 7 rational drivers
4. **Creating Shared Value** (Porter & Kramer): 3 mechanisms — products/markets, value chain, clusters
5. **Purpose-Driven Brand** (Aaker): Authentic, rooted, linked, credible, actionable
6. **Culture Model** (Schein): Artifacts → Espoused values → Underlying assumptions
7. **Reputation Risk Model**: Visibility × Expectation Gap × (1 – Trust Reserve)
8. **Inside-Out Brand Model**: Culture → Employer Brand → Employee Behaviour → Stakeholder Reputation
