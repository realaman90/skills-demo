# Source Quotes — Reputation & Employer Brand

## From Ambler & Barrow (1996) — The Employer Brand

"The employer brand consists of the package of functional, economic, and psychological benefits provided by employment and identified with the employing company."
(from: docs/newskills/09_Reputation_Employer_Brand/The-employer-brand_Tim-Ambler-and-Simon-Barrow.pdf)

"We suggest that managing the employer brand in the same way as a product brand — with segmentation, positioning, and value proposition thinking — provides significant competitive advantage in the talent market."

## From Brown & Dacin (1997) — Corporate Associations

"We distinguish between two types of corporate associations: corporate ability (CA) associations, which reflect the company's expertise in producing and delivering its outputs, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) associations, which reflect the organisation's status and activities with respect to its perceived societal obligations."
(from: docs/newskills/09_Reputation_Employer_Brand/Brown&Dacin.pdf)

"CSR associations do not directly influence product evaluations, but they do create an overall company evaluation that can influence consumer product responses."

## From Porter & Kramer (2011) — Creating Shared Value

"The concept of shared value can be defined as policies and operating practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company while simultaneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates."
(from: docs/newskills/09_Reputation_Employer_Brand/Porter and Kramer (2011) Creating_Shared_Value.pdf)

"The solution lies in the principle of shared value, which involves creating economic value in a way that also creates value for society by addressing its needs and challenges. Businesses must reconnect company success with social progress."
(from: docs/newskills/09_Reputation_Employer_Brand/Porter and Kramer (2011) Creating_Shared_Value.pdf)

"CSV is not about personal values. Nor is it about 'sharing' the value already created by firms — a redistribution approach. Instead, it is about expanding the total pool of economic and social value."
(from: docs/newskills/09_Reputation_Employer_Brand/Porter and Kramer (2011) Creating_Shared_Value.pdf)

## From Aaker — Purpose-Driven Branding

"A higher purpose is an authentic reason for being that inspires the organisation and its stakeholders, goes beyond the product offering, and ideally has a social dimension that makes the world a bit better."
(from: docs/newskills/09_Reputation_Employer_Brand/The Future of Purpose-Driven Branding - David Aaker.pdf)

"Purpose washing — claiming a higher purpose without substantiating it through action — is worse than no purpose claim at all. It creates a credibility gap that brands cannot easily close."
(from: docs/newskills/09_Reputation_Employer_Brand/The Future of Purpose-Driven Branding - David Aaker.pdf)

## From Ponzi et al. (2011) — RepTrak Pulse

"The RepTrak Pulse measure captures the overall emotional sentiment towards a company through four items: good feeling, admire and respect, trust, and esteem. Together these predict stakeholder support behaviours more reliably than any single dimension."
(from: docs/newskills/09_Reputation_Employer_Brand/RepTrak Pulse Measure Ponzi.pdf)

"Stakeholders who trust a company are significantly more likely to buy from it, recommend it, work for it, and invest in it — confirming that trust is the unifying emotional driver of reputation."
(from: docs/newskills/09_Reputation_Employer_Brand/RepTrak Pulse Measure Ponzi.pdf)

## From Schein — Organisational Culture

"Culture is the pattern of basic assumptions that a given group has invented, discovered, or developed in learning to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration."
(from: docs/newskills/09_Reputation_Employer_Brand/Schein.pdf)

"The most dangerous aspect of culture is that it operates below the level of conscious awareness. Leaders who try to change culture through communications or values statements, without addressing the underlying assumptions, will fail."
(paraphrase from: docs/newskills/09_Reputation_Employer_Brand/Schein.pdf)
