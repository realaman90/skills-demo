## The Founding Concept

Ambler and Barrow (1996) introduced the employer brand concept by applying product brand management principles to the employment relationship. They argued that just as product brands create and communicate value to consumers, organisations create and communicate value to employees.

**Definition:** The employer brand is "the package of functional, economic, and psychological benefits provided by employment and identified with the employing company."

## The Three Benefit Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Functional benefits** | Development activities, training, useful skills | Skills training, career development, meaningful work |
| **Economic benefits** | Material and monetary benefits | Salary, bonus, pension, benefits package |
| **Psychological benefits** | Sense of belonging, purpose, identity | Team culture, values alignment, leadership quality |

Traditional HR focused primarily on economic benefits (compensation). Employer branding recognises that psychological benefits — purpose, belonging, identity — are often more powerful drivers of attraction and retention than pay alone.

## The Employee Value Proposition (EVP)

The EVP is the employer brand's articulation of the deal between the organisation and its employees: what the organisation offers, and what it expects in return.

**A strong EVP includes:**
1. **Rewards & Recognition** — compensation, benefits, non-financial recognition
2. **Career & Growth** — development opportunities, promotion pathways, learning
3. **Culture & Environment** — values, team dynamics, leadership style, inclusion
4. **Purpose & Impact** — connection to mission, social impact, meaningful work
5. **Work-Life Integration** — flexibility, autonomy, wellbeing support

**EVP principles:**
- Must be differentiated: what makes working here distinctively different from competitors?
- Must be authentic: based on what actually exists, not aspirational marketing
- Must be consistent: the same EVP must be delivered consistently across the employee lifecycle
- Must be segmented: different talent pools value different EVP components

## The Employer Brand Lifecycle

The employer brand touches every stage of the talent lifecycle:

1. **Attract** — Reputation in talent market; employer brand awareness among candidates
2. **Recruit** — Candidate experience; EVP communication in JDs and interviews
3. **Onboard** — First impressions; culture transmission; promise delivery check
4. **Develop** — Learning & development delivery; career pathway management
5. **Engage** — Day-to-day experience; manager quality; recognition
6. **Retain** — Why people stay; addressing drivers of voluntary turnover
7. **Advocate** — Alumni and active employee advocacy

## Employer Brand Equity

Employer brand equity is the differential effect the employer brand has on talent attraction and retention. A strong employer brand:
- Reduces cost-per-hire (candidates apply proactively)
- Reduces time-to-fill (more and better quality applicants)
- Reduces turnover (employees with strong EVP alignment stay longer)
- Enables quality hires (top talent chooses you over competitors)

**Measurement of employer brand equity:**
- Employer Net Promoter Score (eNPS): "How likely are you to recommend us as an employer?"
- Glassdoor / LinkedIn employer ratings vs. competitors
- Offer acceptance rates
- Application-to-hire quality ratios
- Voluntary attrition vs. industry benchmark

## Employer Brand vs. Employee Experience

| Concept | Focus | Who Owns It |
|---|---|---|
| Employer Brand | How the organisation is perceived as an employer (external + internal image) | HR + Marketing/Brand |
| Employee Experience | What it actually feels like to work there (day-to-day reality) | HR + Operations |

The employer brand makes a promise; the employee experience must deliver it. A gap between the two is the primary driver of employer brand damage — particularly in the era of Glassdoor and LinkedIn transparency.

## Employer Branding in the Literature Review Context

The employer branding literature links employer brand equity directly to financial outcomes:
- Lower recruitment costs
- Higher engagement (linked to productivity)
- Lower turnover costs
- Improved customer satisfaction (engaged employees serve customers better)

The brand equity literature applies here: just as product brand equity creates financial value, employer brand equity creates organisational value through the talent pipeline.
