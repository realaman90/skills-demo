## What Is Reputation Risk?

Reputation risk is the potential for loss of trust, goodwill, or stakeholder support — and the resulting financial or operational consequences — resulting from actual or perceived failures in behaviour, communication, or alignment between stated values and actions.

Reputation risk is not a standalone risk; it is typically the consequence of other risks materialising in public view:
- Operational failure + public awareness = reputation risk
- Ethical failure + media coverage = reputation risk
- Product quality failure + social amplification = reputation risk

## Sources of Reputation Risk

### Internal Sources
| Source | Example |
|---|---|
| Executive misconduct | CEO scandal, leadership failures |
| Product/service failure | Recalls, safety incidents, data breaches |
| Culture and employment practices | Discrimination, harassment, toxic culture exposed |
| Financial irregularities | Accounting fraud, insider trading |
| Governance failures | Board conflicts, related-party transactions |
| Environmental incidents | Spills, emissions violations |

### External Sources
| Source | Example |
|---|---|
| Social media amplification | Consumer complaints going viral |
| Activist campaigns | NGO targeting, consumer boycotts |
| Regulatory action | Investigation, fines, enforcement |
| Competitive attacks | Comparative advertising, leaked information |
| Supply chain failures | Third-party labour practices exposed |
| Macro/geopolitical | Brand caught in political controversy |

## The Reputation Risk Exposure Model

Three factors determine reputation risk exposure:

1. **Visibility** — How prominent is the organisation? Higher-profile organisations face higher scrutiny
2. **Expectation gap** — The larger the gap between stakeholder expectations and reality, the greater the risk
3. **Vulnerability** — How resilient is the organisation to bad news? (Trust reserves, crisis history)

**Formula (conceptual):**
Reputation Risk = Visibility × Expectation Gap × (1 – Trust Reserve)

High trust (built through consistent behaviour over time) is the primary buffer against reputation risk.

## Reputation Risk Management Framework

### Step 1: Risk Identification
- Map all stakeholder groups and their key expectations
- Identify where current reality fails to meet expectations (gap analysis)
- Scan for emerging issues (regulatory, social, competitive)

### Step 2: Risk Assessment
For each identified risk:
- **Probability**: How likely is this to occur?
- **Severity**: If it occurs, how damaging is it?
- **Detectability**: How early can we detect it?
- **Recoverability**: How quickly can reputation be restored?

### Step 3: Risk Mitigation
- **Prevention**: Close the expectation gap (fix the underlying issue)
- **Preparation**: Develop crisis communications plans for high-severity risks
- **Trust building**: Invest in reputation dimensions (RepTrak) before crises occur
- **Monitoring**: Social listening, media monitoring, employee pulse surveys

### Step 4: Crisis Response (when a risk materialises)
1. **Speed**: Acknowledge the issue quickly; silence amplifies damage
2. **Transparency**: Communicate honestly about what happened and what is being done
3. **Accountability**: Accept responsibility where appropriate; avoid deflection
4. **Action**: Show concrete steps being taken to address the problem
5. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent messaging across all channels and spokespersons

## The Trust Buffer Effect

Organisations with high baseline trust recover from reputation crises faster and with less financial damage:
- J&J's Tylenol crisis (1982): High trust enabled rapid recovery through transparent, decisive action
- Organisations with low trust pre-crisis often cannot recover even with good crisis response

**Implication**: Reputation risk management is primarily proactive (building trust reserves) not reactive (responding to crises).

## Reputation Risk and Employer Brand

Reputation crises damage employer brand directly:
- Glassdoor applications drop during and after crises
- Top talent chooses employers with stronger reputations
- Employee morale and engagement drop during crises
- Key talent exits increase during reputation crises

Employer brand recovery after a crisis requires:
1. Internal communication first — employees must hear the company's position before media does
2. Demonstrated cultural change — not just messaging
3. Leadership accountability — no recovery without visible leadership accountability
