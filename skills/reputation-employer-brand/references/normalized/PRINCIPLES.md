# Reputation & Employer Brand — Core Principles

## The Two Sides of Organisational Brand

Organisations project brand in two directions simultaneously:

| Direction | Audience | Concept | Key Question |
|---|---|---|---|
| **External** | Consumers, investors, media, regulators | Corporate Reputation | What do stakeholders believe about who we are and what we stand for? |
| **Internal** | Employees, candidates | Employer Brand | Why would talented people choose to work here and stay? |

Both are expressions of the same organisational identity — but they are managed through different levers and measured differently. A misalignment between internal and external brand is a leading source of reputation risk.

## Corporate Reputation: Definition

Corporate reputation is the collective assessment of a company's past actions and future prospects that describes how well the company meets the expectations of its multiple stakeholders.

Key characteristics:
- **Multi-stakeholder**: Different stakeholder groups (consumers, employees, investors, regulators) hold different reputational assessments
- **Historical accumulation**: Reputation is built over time; it cannot be created quickly
- **Fragile asymmetry**: It takes years to build and can be destroyed in days
- **Perceptual**: Reputation exists in minds, not in the company; it can diverge from reality

## Employer Brand: Definition

The employer brand is the package of functional, economic, and psychological benefits provided by employment and identified with the employing company. (Ambler & Barrow, 1996)

The employer brand applies the same principles as product/service brand management to the employment relationship:
- The "product" is the job and company as an employer
- The "customers" are employees and prospective candidates
- The "value proposition" is the Employee Value Proposition (EVP)

## Why Both Matter Together

1. **Talent is a strategic asset**: In knowledge economies, attracting and retaining talent is a competitive advantage
2. **Employees are brand ambassadors**: What employees say about the company shapes consumer and investor reputation
3. **Inside-out brand building**: Authentic reputation is built from genuine culture and values — not communications alone
4. **ESG and stakeholder capitalism**: Investors, regulators, and consumers increasingly assess companies on social and governance criteria
5. **Purpose premium**: Companies with a credible higher purpose attract stronger talent and can command consumer loyalty premiums

## The Culture-Reputation Connection (Schein)

Edgar Schein's model of organisational culture identifies three levels:
1. **Artifacts** — visible structures, processes, behaviour (what you see)
2. **Espoused values** — stated strategies, goals, philosophies (what is said)
3. **Underlying assumptions** — unconscious beliefs, taken-for-granted perceptions (what is truly believed)

**Key principle**: Reputation follows culture. If the underlying assumptions are misaligned with the espoused values, communications cannot sustain reputation long-term. Culture must be actively managed, not assumed.

## The Inside-Outside Model

```
[Culture & Values]
      ↓
[Employer Brand / EVP]
      ↓
[Employee Experience & Behaviour]
      ↓
[External Brand Signals to Consumers / Investors]
      ↓
[Corporate Reputation]
```

Strong reputations are built from the inside out. Organisations that try to manage reputation externally without addressing internal culture create a credibility gap — and that gap eventually becomes a reputation risk.
