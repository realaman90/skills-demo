## The RepTrak Model

RepTrak is the global standard for measuring corporate reputation, developed by the Reputation Institute (now RepTrak). It measures reputation across two levels:

### Level 1: RepTrak Pulse (Emotional Reputation Score)
Four emotional indicators that give the overall reputation score:
1. **Good feeling** — I have a good feeling about the company
2. **Admire & respect** — I admire and respect the company
3. **Trust** — I trust the company
4. **Esteem** — I hold the company in high esteem

These four items (scored 0–100) form the overall RepTrak Pulse score — the headline reputation metric.

### Level 2: The Seven RepTrak Dimensions (Rational Drivers)
The seven dimensions that drive the emotional pulse scores:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| **Products & Services** | Quality, value, meets needs, stands behind |
| **Innovation** | Innovative, first to market, adapts to change |
| **Workplace** | Rewarding workplace, employee wellbeing, strong leadership |
| **Governance** | Open/transparent, ethical behaviour, fair in business |
| **Citizenship** | Positive societal impact, environmental responsibility |
| **Leadership** | Well-organised, clear vision, excellent management |
| **Performance** | Profitable, strong financial results, growth prospects |

## RepTrak Pulse Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| 80–100 | Excellent — strong support and advocacy |
| 70–79 | Strong — most stakeholders have positive perceptions |
| 60–69 | Average — mixed perceptions; some risk |
| 40–59 | Weak — trust is low; vulnerability to scrutiny |
| 0–39 | Poor — active distrust; brand is under threat |

## RepTrak in Practice

**How it is used:**
- Annual or quarterly surveys of representative stakeholder panels
- Benchmarked against industry peers and global top-100 companies
- Identifies which of the 7 dimensions is the primary driver of reputation strength or weakness
- Enables targeted investment decisions (which dimension to fix first)

**Derived metrics from RepTrak:**
- **Willingness to buy**: Driven primarily by Products & Services + Performance
- **Willingness to recommend**: Driven by trust + Products & Services
- **Willingness to work for**: Driven primarily by Workplace + Leadership + Citizenship
- **Willingness to invest in**: Driven primarily by Performance + Governance + Leadership
- **Willingness to give benefit of the doubt in a crisis**: Driven by Governance + Citizenship + Trust

## Other Reputation Measurement Approaches

### Media Analysis / Sentiment Tracking
- Quantitative analysis of brand mentions across media
- Sentiment classification (positive/neutral/negative)
- Share of voice vs. competitors
- Useful for tracking reputation in real time; less reliable as a standalone measure

### Stakeholder Surveys (Custom)
- Tailored surveys for each stakeholder group
- Can include qualitative probing on specific issues
- More expensive but more nuanced than standardised models

### Glassdoor / LinkedIn Employer Reputation
- Employee-reported ratings: overall employer rating, CEO approval, recommend to a friend
- Culture & Values, Diversity & Inclusion, Work-Life Balance, Senior Management, Compensation
- Transparent to all candidates — a major employer brand signal

### Social Listening
- Real-time monitoring of brand sentiment on social platforms
- Leading indicator of emerging reputation issues before they hit mainstream media
- Cannot replace structured survey measurement

## Linking Reputation Measurement to Business Outcomes

RepTrak has established correlations between reputation scores and:
- Revenue growth
- Stock price performance
- Crisis recovery speed
- Employee attraction and retention quality
- Regulatory leniency

The strongest predictor of reputation-driven purchase intent is the combination of Products & Services + Governance. Trust underlies all dimensions.
