# Reputation & Employer Brand — Glossary

**Employer Brand**
The package of functional, economic, and psychological benefits provided by employment and identified with the employing company (Ambler & Barrow, 1996). The organisation's identity as an employer, as perceived by employees and candidates.

**EVP (Employee Value Proposition)**
The articulation of what an organisation offers employees in exchange for their contribution. Components: rewards & recognition, career & growth, culture & environment, purpose & impact, work-life integration.

**Corporate Reputation**
The collective multi-stakeholder assessment of a company's past actions and future prospects; the aggregated perception of how well a company meets stakeholder expectations.

**Corporate Associations (Brown & Dacin)**
Two types: Corporate Ability (CA) — perceptions of product/service expertise; and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) — perceptions of social character and values.

**Corporate Ability (CA)**
Consumer perceptions of a company's competence in manufacturing or delivering its products/services. Drives product quality evaluations and purchase intent.

**CSR Associations**
Consumer perceptions of a company's character in relation to social and ethical issues. Drives brand warmth, trust, and advocacy among socially conscious consumers.

**RepTrak**
The global standard for corporate reputation measurement. RepTrak Pulse = four emotional indicators (good feeling, admire & respect, trust, esteem). Seven rational drivers: Products & Services, Innovation, Workplace, Governance, Citizenship, Leadership, Performance.

**RepTrak Pulse**
The headline reputation score (0–100) derived from four emotional items about a company. Threshold: 70+ = strong; 60–69 = average; <60 = weak/at risk.

**Creating Shared Value (CSV)**
Porter & Kramer (2011): The idea that companies can create economic value in a way that also creates value for society by addressing social needs. Three mechanisms: reconceiving products/markets, redefining value chain productivity, enabling local cluster development.

**CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)**
Company actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and what is required by law. Distinguished from CSV: CSR is peripheral; CSV is strategic.

**Purpose-Driven Brand**
A brand that articulates a higher reason for existence beyond commercial profit — a genuine social or cultural contribution that guides decisions and inspires stakeholders.

**Purpose Washing**
Using purpose language as a marketing claim without operational substance. Damages credibility when the gap between claim and reality is exposed.

**Schein's Culture Levels**
Three levels of organisational culture: (1) Artifacts — visible symbols and behaviours; (2) Espoused values — stated beliefs and strategies; (3) Underlying assumptions — deeply held, often unconscious beliefs that drive actual behaviour.

**Credibility Gap**
The gap between what an organisation says (espoused values) and what it actually does (driven by underlying assumptions). The primary source of reputation risk.

**Reputation Risk**
The potential for loss of stakeholder trust resulting from actual or perceived failures in behaviour, communication, or value alignment. A consequence of other risks materialising publicly.

**Trust Reserve**
The accumulated trust that stakeholders have in an organisation, built through consistent behaviour over time. Acts as a buffer in reputation crises — high trust = faster recovery.

**Employer NPS (eNPS)**
Employee Net Promoter Score: "How likely are you to recommend us as an employer?" Calculated as % promoters minus % detractors.

**Stakeholder Mapping**
The process of identifying all groups with a stake in the organisation, assessing their expectations, and prioritising engagement based on their power, legitimacy, and urgency.

**Corporate Identity**
How the organisation sees and presents itself (internal, designed). Distinct from corporate image (how stakeholders see it) and corporate reputation (the aggregated longitudinal assessment).

**Collective Impact**
A model for addressing complex social problems through structured cross-sector collaboration — multiple organisations working together with shared measurement and mutually reinforcing activities.

**Psychological Safety**
The shared belief that the team or organisation is safe for interpersonal risk-taking — speaking up, admitting failures, proposing new ideas. A key driver of engagement, innovation, and cultural health.
