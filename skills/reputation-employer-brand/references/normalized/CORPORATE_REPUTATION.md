## Brown & Dacin: Corporate Associations Framework

Brown & Dacin (1997) identify two distinct types of corporate associations that affect how consumers evaluate a company's products:

### 1. Corporate Ability (CA) Associations
Perceptions of the company's expertise in producing and delivering its products and services.
- "Does this company know how to make good products?"
- Linked to: innovation capability, technical expertise, quality track record, scale

**CA affects**: Product quality evaluations, purchase intent, product trial

### 2. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Associations
Perceptions of the company's social character — its relationship with social issues, communities, and stakeholders beyond its commercial interests.
- "Is this company a good corporate citizen?"
- Linked to: environmental practices, community investment, employee treatment, ethical sourcing

**CSR affects**: Brand warmth, trust, advocacy, preference among socially conscious consumers

## The Interaction of CA and CSR

| CA | CSR | Consumer Response |
|---|---|---|
| High | High | Maximum trust and preference |
| High | Low | Respected but not liked; vulnerable to activism |
| Low | High | Liked but not trusted on product quality |
| Low | Low | Weak reputation across all dimensions |

**Key insight**: CA is often the foundation — poor CA cannot be compensated by strong CSR alone. But in categories where quality parity exists, CSR becomes a tiebreaker.

## Secondary Associations and Corporate Brand

Keller's secondary associations framework (relevant to corporate brand):
Organisations can leverage associations from:
- Country of origin ("Made in Germany" → engineering quality)
- Corporate heritage (founding story, legacy brand)
- Awards and certifications (quality signals)
- Partnerships and endorsements (credibility transfer)
- Corporate leadership (CEO as brand asset)

These secondary associations are particularly valuable for new markets or new product categories where direct corporate ability is not yet established.

## Argenti: Corporate Communication as Reputation Management

Paul Argenti frames corporate communication as the management of stakeholder relationships through intentional messaging. Key principles:

**Stakeholder mapping for reputation:**
1. Identify all stakeholder groups (consumers, employees, investors, regulators, media, communities)
2. Assess their expectations of the organisation
3. Prioritise based on power, legitimacy, and urgency
4. Tailor communication to each stakeholder's concerns

**The alignment imperative:**
Corporate communication must align with corporate reality. Overpromising on values or capabilities creates a credibility gap that, when exposed, becomes a reputation crisis.

**Corporate identity vs. corporate image vs. corporate reputation:**
- **Identity**: How the organisation sees itself (internal, designed)
- **Image**: How stakeholders see the organisation (external, perceived)
- **Reputation**: The aggregated, longitudinal assessment across all stakeholders

Identity → Image → Reputation is the sequence. But reputation is built through action, not design.

## Multi-Stakeholder Reputation

Different stakeholder groups hold different reputation assessments:

| Stakeholder | Key Driver of Reputation |
|---|---|
| Consumers | Product quality + CSR associations |
| Employees / Candidates | Culture + leadership + purpose |
| Investors | Financial performance + governance + risk management |
| Regulators | Compliance + transparency |
| Media | Newsworthiness + accessibility + transparency |
| Communities | Local impact + environmental behaviour |

Reputation strategy must address all stakeholder groups — but prioritise based on strategic importance.

## Reputation as a Strategic Asset

Corporate reputation is increasingly recognised as a quantifiable financial asset:
- Reputation accounts for a significant portion of market capitalisation in many industries
- Strong reputation reduces cost of capital (investors accept lower risk premiums)
- Strong reputation enables premium pricing (consumers pay more from trusted companies)
- Reputation is a barrier to competitive entry (trust is hard to copy quickly)
