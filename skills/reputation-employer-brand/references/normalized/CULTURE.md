## Schein's Three-Level Model of Culture

Edgar Schein identifies three levels of organisational culture, from most visible to most deeply embedded:

### Level 1: Artifacts
**What you see and hear**
- Physical environment, architecture, office design
- Observed behaviours, rituals, ceremonies
- Technology in use
- Language, stories, myths told about the organisation
- Dress codes, org charts, published processes

Artifacts are visible but their meaning is not always interpretable without context. The same artifact (e.g., open plan office) can mean different things in different cultures.

### Level 2: Espoused Values
**What is said and officially believed**
- Stated strategies, goals, philosophies
- Published values and principles
- What leaders say in speeches, communications, and interviews
- Codes of conduct

Espoused values are what the organisation claims to believe. They may or may not reflect actual behaviour. When espoused values and actual behaviour diverge, employees and observers notice — and reputation suffers.

### Level 3: Basic Underlying Assumptions
**What is truly believed (often unconsciously)**
- Taken-for-granted perceptions of reality
- Unconscious beliefs about human nature, time, space, and relationships
- The "way things really work around here" vs. "what we say we do"

Underlying assumptions are the most stable and resistant-to-change element of culture. They drive actual behaviour. Changing culture requires surfacing and challenging these assumptions — which is difficult and slow.

## Culture and Reputation

| Culture Level | Reputation Impact |
|---|---|
| Artifacts | First impressions for candidates, visitors, media |
| Espoused values | What the brand claims; sets expectations |
| Underlying assumptions | Actual behaviour; what employees report; what crises reveal |

**The credibility gap**: When a company's stated values (Level 2) conflict with its actual behaviour (driven by Level 3), stakeholders experience a credibility gap. This gap is the most common source of reputation damage.

**Example**: A company espousing "employee wellbeing" (Level 2) but whose underlying assumptions drive 80-hour weeks and aggressive stack ranking (Level 3) will eventually surface on Glassdoor, in media, or through legal action — damaging both employer brand and corporate reputation.

## Culture Change and Employer Brand

Culture cannot be changed through communications alone. Schein's model implies:
1. **Diagnose the underlying assumptions first**: What do people really believe about how success is achieved here?
2. **Identify the gap** between espoused values and actual behaviour
3. **Structural interventions**: Change incentives, promotions, and consequences to shift behaviour
4. **Leadership modelling**: Culture changes when leaders consistently model new assumptions in their decisions
5. **Patient consistency**: Culture change takes 3–7 years minimum for large organisations

For employer brand: the EVP must reflect real culture, not desired culture. Promising an employee experience that doesn't yet exist is worse than having a modest but honest EVP.

## Psychological Safety (Related)

Schein's work connects to Amy Edmondson's concept of psychological safety — the belief that one can speak up, take risks, and fail without punishment. Cultures with high psychological safety:
- Surface problems faster (reducing operational and reputation risk)
- Enable innovation (people try new things)
- Support inclusion (diverse voices are heard)
- Drive engagement (people bring full selves to work)

Psychological safety is an underlying assumption that must be actively cultivated by leadership behaviour, not just declared in a values statement.

## Culture Assessment Methods

1. **Cultural audit**: Interviews and surveys mapping all three levels
2. **Artefact walk**: Systematic review of visible symbols and stories
3. **Value alignment survey**: Compare espoused values to perceived actual behaviour
4. **Engagement and culture pulse surveys**: Regular tracking of cultural health metrics
5. **Exit interview analysis**: What do leavers say about the real culture?
6. **Glassdoor/social listening**: What do current and former employees say externally?
