# ASSIGNMENT GUIDE: Reputation & Employer Brand

## Your role vs. the AI's role

**You** diagnose the organisational reality. **The skill** applies the frameworks.

Reputation and employer brand analysis requires inside-out thinking. The skill knows RepTrak, Brown & Dacin, Ambler & Barrow, Schein, and Porter & Kramer. What it cannot know is the real culture of your chosen organisation — what employees actually experience, what the gap is between stated values and lived reality, and what specific stakeholder groups believe about the company. That requires your research.

## What this skill covers

- Employer brand: Ambler & Barrow's framework, the EVP (functional/economic/psychological benefits)
- Corporate reputation: Brown & Dacin's CA (corporate ability) and CSR (social character) associations
- RepTrak: Pulse score (4 emotional items) + 7 rational drivers
- Culture: Schein's three levels (artifacts, espoused values, underlying assumptions)
- Creating Shared Value: Porter & Kramer's CSV vs. CSR distinction
- Purpose-driven brand: Aaker's authenticity criteria, purpose washing risk
- Reputation risk: sources, exposure model, trust buffer, crisis response

## Before you open the skill

Do this yourself first:

1. Identify the organisation's stated values and employer brand claims (website, careers page, annual report).
2. Find evidence of what employees actually experience: Glassdoor reviews, LinkedIn employee posts, news articles, any public survey data.
3. Identify the gap between (1) and (2). Is there a credibility gap? How large is it?
4. Apply Schein: what do the artifacts (office culture, visible behaviours, news stories) suggest about the underlying assumptions? Do they match the espoused values?
5. Rate the organisation on RepTrak's 7 dimensions based on available evidence: Products & Services, Innovation, Workplace, Governance, Citizenship, Leadership, Performance.

## Suggested workflow

1. Complete your own reputation and culture diagnosis — write a paragraph on the credibility gap
2. Use the skill in **learn mode**: share your diagnosis and ask it to challenge your assessment using RepTrak and Schein
3. Use **diagnose mode** to run the full corporate associations and culture audit
4. Use **strategy mode** if your brief requires CSV or purpose strategy recommendations
5. Use **protect mode** to assess and prioritise reputation risks
6. Write your assignment — cite Brown & Dacin (1997), Ambler & Barrow (1996), Schein, and Porter & Kramer

---

## What the skill will probe you on (learn mode)

- Is the credibility gap you identified based on evidence or impression?
- What specifically in the artifacts (Level 1) contradicts the espoused values (Level 2)?
- Are you calling this "CSR" when it might be genuine Creating Shared Value — or vice versa?
- What RepTrak dimensions are most at risk for this organisation? What evidence supports that?
- Is the employer brand claim authentic (supported by employee data) or aspirational (not yet delivered)?

---

## What your examiner will ask

- "Apply Brown & Dacin's CA and CSR model. What are the organisation's corporate ability associations and its CSR associations? Which is stronger?"
- "Diagnose this organisation using Schein's three levels. Where is the credibility gap?"
- "Rate this organisation on RepTrak's 7 dimensions and justify each rating. Which dimension poses the greatest reputation risk?"
- "Is this organisation's purpose claim authentic CSV or purpose washing? Justify your assessment using Porter & Kramer's criteria."
- "Design the first 12 months of an employer brand recovery plan following a reputation crisis."

## Academic integrity note

Reputation and culture analysis requires evidence from multiple sources: employee data, consumer surveys, media analysis, financial performance, governance disclosures. An analysis based only on the company's own communications is a description of what the company says, not an assessment of what stakeholders believe. Your examiner expects triangulated evidence.
