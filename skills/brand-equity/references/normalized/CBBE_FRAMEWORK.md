## The CBBE Pyramid (4 Levels)

The CBBE model is a pyramid with 4 sequential levels and 6 brand-building blocks. Higher levels depend on the lower levels being established first.

```
         [RESONANCE]
       /              \
  [JUDGMENTS]    [FEELINGS]
  /                         \
[PERFORMANCE]          [IMAGERY]
            \           /
           [BRAND SALIENCE]
```

### Level 1: Brand Salience (Identity)
**Question: Who are you?**
- Depth of brand awareness (ease of brand recall)
- Breadth of brand awareness (range of purchase situations in which the brand comes to mind)
- Category identification — what products does the brand represent?

Strong salience = the brand comes to mind easily in all relevant buying situations.

### Level 2: Brand Performance + Brand Imagery (Meaning)
**Question: What are you?**

**Brand Performance** (functional associations):
- Primary characteristics and features
- Product reliability, durability, serviceability
- Service effectiveness, efficiency, empathy
- Style and design
- Price

**Brand Imagery** (psychological/social associations):
- User profiles (who uses this brand — demographic, psychographic)
- Purchase and usage situations
- Personality and values
- History, heritage, and experiences

### Level 3: Brand Judgments + Brand Feelings (Response)
**Question: What about you?**

**Brand Judgments** (cognitive evaluations):
- Quality
- Credibility
- Consideration
- Superiority

**Brand Feelings** (emotional responses):
- Warmth
- Fun
- Excitement
- Security
- Social approval
- Self-respect

### Level 4: Brand Resonance (Relationship)
**Question: What about you and me?**
- Behavioural loyalty (repeat purchase, share of wallet)
- Attitudinal attachment (love of the brand)
- Sense of community (with other users)
- Active engagement (brand ambassadorship, fan communities)

Resonance is the pinnacle — it is the ultimate goal of brand building.

## The Six Brand-Building Blocks

| Block | Level | Type | Key Question |
|---|---|---|---|
| Salience | 1 | Identity | Do customers know who you are? |
| Performance | 2 | Meaning | Do customers know what you offer functionally? |
| Imagery | 2 | Meaning | Do customers know what you represent symbolically? |
| Judgments | 3 | Response | How do customers evaluate you? |
| Feelings | 3 | Response | How do customers feel about you? |
| Resonance | 4 | Relationship | Do customers have a deep, loyal bond with you? |

## Implications for Equity Building

- **Weak salience** → Invest in awareness campaigns, distinctive assets
- **Weak performance perceptions** → Product improvement + education campaigns
- **Weak imagery** → Brand personality, lifestyle associations, sponsorships
- **Negative judgments** → Credibility rebuild, quality signals, transparency
- **No feelings** → Emotional advertising, experiential marketing
- **No resonance** → Loyalty programmes, community building, co-creation

## CBBE and Brand Extensions

A brand with strong equity can support extensions if:
- The extension is consistent with the brand's associations at the Performance or Imagery level
- The extension does not conflict with existing Judgments or Feelings
- The extension reinforces rather than dilutes the Salience of the core brand
