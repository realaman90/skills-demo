## Brand Knowledge as an Associative Network

Brand knowledge is stored in memory as an **associative network** — nodes connected by links. The brand name is a central node; associations branch off from it. The strength of an association determines how easily it is activated.

Two components of brand knowledge:
1. **Brand Awareness**
2. **Brand Image**

## Brand Awareness

### Recognition
Can the consumer confirm prior exposure to the brand when cued by the brand element (name, logo, symbol)?
- Low-involvement purchases (e.g., packaged goods at shelf) rely heavily on recognition
- Recognition drives point-of-sale decisions

### Recall
Can the consumer retrieve the brand from memory when given the product category as a cue?
- High-involvement purchases (e.g., service providers, B2B) rely more on unaided recall
- Recall drives consideration set inclusion

### Depth vs. Breadth of Awareness
- **Depth**: How easily does the brand come to mind?
- **Breadth**: In how many situations/categories does the brand come to mind?
  - Narrow breadth = the brand only comes to mind in specific, restricted situations
  - Broad breadth = the brand comes to mind across many usage occasions and need states

## Brand Image

Brand image is the set of associations linked to the brand in consumer memory.

### Types of Brand Associations

| Type | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Attributes | Descriptive features of the product or service | Price, colour, packaging, ingredients |
| Benefits | Personal value consumers attach to attributes | Functional, experiential, symbolic |
| Attitudes | Overall evaluation of the brand | Positive, negative, mixed |

### Attributes
- **Product-related**: directly related to product function (ingredients, features)
- **Non-product-related**: price, packaging, user imagery, usage imagery

### Benefits
- **Functional** — practical utility; what the product does for you
- **Experiential** — what it feels like to use the product
- **Symbolic** — self-concept, social approval, group membership

### Attitudes
Overall brand attitude is the most abstract brand association and underlies consumer behaviour.

## Evaluating Brand Associations

Three dimensions determine the quality of a brand association:

| Dimension | Description |
|---|---|
| **Favourability** | Is the association positive or negative? |
| **Strength** | How strongly is it linked to the brand in memory? |
| **Uniqueness** | Does it differentiate the brand from competitors? |

Positive brand equity requires associations that are:
- Favourable — the consumer values them
- Strong — they are reliably activated
- Unique — competitors don't own them equally

## Implications for Diagnosis

When diagnosing a brand's equity:
1. Map all associations consumers hold toward the brand
2. Rate each association on favourability, strength, uniqueness
3. Identify whether awareness is breadth-limited or depth-limited
4. Assess whether associations align with intended brand positioning
5. Identify "owned" associations vs. shared/generic associations

## The Role of Secondary Associations

Brands can build knowledge by linking to other entities:
- Companies (corporate credibility)
- Countries of origin (e.g., "German engineering")
- Distribution channels (where it is sold signals quality)
- Characters, spokespersons, events
- Other brands (co-branding, ingredient branding)

Secondary associations can rapidly transfer equity — or dilute it if the linked entity is negatively perceived.
