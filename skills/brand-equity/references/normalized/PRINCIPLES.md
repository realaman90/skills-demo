# Brand Equity — Core Principles

## What Is Brand Equity?

Brand equity is the differential effect that brand knowledge has on consumer response to the marketing of that brand. A brand has positive equity when consumers react more favourably to a product or service because of the brand name than they would to the same product or service without that brand name.

Three common but distinct uses of the term "brand equity" (Feldwick, 1996):
1. **Brand strength** — a set of associations and behaviours that enables the brand to earn greater volume or margin than it could without the brand name
2. **Brand value** — the financial worth of the brand as an asset (used in accounting and M&A)
3. **Brand description** — associations, personality, image that characterise the brand

## Why Brand Equity Matters

- Brands with strong equity command price premiums
- Strong equity reduces customer acquisition costs (existing loyalty)
- Brand equity is a key intangible asset on the balance sheet
- Equity enables successful extensions into adjacent categories
- High equity brands are more resilient to competitive attacks and crises

## Keller's Customer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE)

The power of a brand resides in the minds of customers. CBBE occurs when the consumer has a high level of awareness and familiarity with the brand and holds some strong, favourable, and unique brand associations.

**Two sources of CBBE:**
1. Brand awareness (recognition + recall)
2. Brand image (the set of associations linked to the brand)

## Brand Knowledge Structure

Brand knowledge is an associative network memory model:
- **Nodes** — stored information and concepts
- **Links** — associative connections between nodes
- Brand associations differ in type, favourability, strength, and uniqueness

## Principles of Equity Building

1. **Consistency** — brand associations must be consistently reinforced over time
2. **Relevance** — associations must matter to the target customer
3. **Credibility** — the brand must deliver on its associations
4. **Distinctiveness** — associations should differentiate the brand from competitors
5. **Depth** — associations should be deeply held (strong, accessible memories)

## The Equity-Dilution Risk

Brand equity can be diluted by:
- Inconsistent brand communications
- Extensions that weaken core associations
- Quality failures that break credibility
- Overextension into too many product categories
- Me-too positioning that destroys distinctiveness

## Trust as Brand Equity

Tim Ambler argues that trust is a central component of brand equity — particularly in relationship-heavy categories. Trust accumulates slowly and is lost quickly. Brand equity built on trust is durable and hard for competitors to replicate.
