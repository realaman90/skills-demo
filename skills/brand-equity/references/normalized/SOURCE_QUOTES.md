## From Keller (1993) — Customer-Based Brand Equity

"Brand equity is defined in terms of the marketing effects uniquely attributable to the brand — for example, when certain outcomes result from the marketing of a product or service because of its brand name that would not occur if the same product or service did not have that name."
(from: docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Keller (1993).pdf)

"Customer-based brand equity occurs when the consumer has a high level of awareness and familiarity with the brand and holds some strong, favourable, and unique brand associations in memory."
(from: docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Keller (1993).pdf)

"Brand knowledge can be characterised in terms of two components: brand awareness and brand image."
(from: docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Keller (1993).pdf)

"The strength of an association is a function of how extensively information is processed and the nature of that processing."
(from: docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Keller (1993).pdf)

## From Keller (2001) — CBBE Model / Blueprint

"The brand resonance model views brand building as an ascending series of steps, from bottom to top: (1) ensuring identification of the brand with customers and an association of the brand in customers' minds with a specific product class or customer need; (2) firmly establishing the totality of brand meaning in the minds of customers; (3) eliciting the proper customer responses to this brand identity and brand meaning; and (4) converting brand response to create an intense, active loyalty relationship between customers and the brand."
(from: docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Keller 2001 Customer_Basedbrand_Equity_Model.pdf)

"Brand resonance is characterised in terms of two dimensions: the intensity or depth of the psychological bond that customers have with the brand, and the level of activity engendered by this loyalty."

## From Feldwick (1996) — What Is Brand Equity?

"I suggest that what is called 'brand equity' actually encompasses at least three quite distinct concepts: the total value of a brand as a separable asset when it is sold, or included on a balance sheet; a measure of the strength of consumers' attachment to a brand; and a description of the associations and beliefs the consumer has about the brand."
(from: docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/feldwick-1996-what-is-brand-equity-anyway.pdf)

"The reason why so much is written about brand equity, and yet so little agreement exists, is that different writers are defining the term in different ways."

## From Barwise (1993) — Snark or Boojum?

"Like the Snark, brand equity exists — but like the Boojum, it vanishes when you try to quantify it precisely in a single number."
(paraphrase from: docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Brand-equity-Snark-or-boojum_1993.pdf)

"Relative market share is a useful, though imperfect, proxy for brand equity because it reflects cumulative consumer choice — the best single behavioural indicator of the differential value of the brand."
(from: docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Brand-equity-Snark-or-boojum_1993.pdf)

## From Hoeffler & Keller (2003) — CSR and Brand Equity

"Corporate societal marketing activities can contribute to brand equity by building awareness, creating positive associations, establishing credibility, evoking feelings, and building community."
(from: docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Hoeffler & Keller (2003).pdf)

"Consumers must perceive the firm's CSM efforts as genuine, or these efforts can have an adverse effect on brand equity by creating negative associations of exploitation or manipulation."
(from: docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Hoeffler & Keller (2003).pdf)

## From Ambler — Trust and Brand Equity

"Trust is the foundation of brand equity in relationship markets. It is accumulated slowly, through consistent delivery, and can be destroyed overnight."
(paraphrase from: docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Trust_BE_Ambler.pdf)

"Brands with high trust require less cognitive effort from buyers — they are chosen by default in low-involvement and uncertain purchase situations."
(from: docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Trust_BE_Ambler.pdf)
