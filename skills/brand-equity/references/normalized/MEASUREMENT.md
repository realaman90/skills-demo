## Why Measurement Is Hard

Brand equity is a multi-dimensional construct. No single metric captures it fully. Different stakeholders (marketers, finance, researchers) prefer different measures because they serve different purposes.

Feldwick's observation: the reason brand equity measurement is contested is because the term means different things to different people — loyalty, financial value, or image profile.

## Customer-Based Equity Measurement Approaches

### 1. Brand Awareness Measures

**Unaided recall:**
- "Name the first brand that comes to mind in category X"
- Measures depth and order of recall (top-of-mind vs. aided)

**Aided recognition:**
- "Have you heard of Brand X?"
- Lower bar than recall; measures breadth of awareness

**Share of mind:** The proportion of recall mentions across the competitive set.

### 2. Brand Association Measures

**Free association:**
- "What comes to mind when you think of Brand X?"
- Reveals the spontaneous association network

**Attribute rating scales:**
- Consumers rate the brand on a set of attributes (quality, trust, modernity, etc.)
- Results mapped against competitors via perceptual maps

**Brand imagery profiles:**
- User imagery (who uses this brand?)
- Usage imagery (when/where is it used?)
- Personality ratings (Aaker's 5-dimension scale)

**Projective techniques:**
- Metaphor elicitation (ZMET)
- Brand collage
- Brand personification ("If this brand were a person, who would it be?")

### 3. Perceived Quality

**Direct quality ratings:** Consumer ratings of overall quality vs. competitors.
**Premium price tolerance:** "What is the most you would pay for Brand X?"
**Quality-to-value ratio:** Perceived quality relative to price paid.

### 4. Brand Loyalty Measures

**Behavioural loyalty:**
- Repurchase rate / retention
- Share of requirements (what % of category purchases are Brand X?)
- Switching rates to/from Brand X

**Attitudinal loyalty:**
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) — likelihood to recommend
- Brand commitment / advocacy

### 5. Brand Resonance Measures

**Attachment:** "How much do you feel a personal connection with Brand X?"
**Community:** Brand community membership, engagement rates
**Active engagement:** User-generated content, brand advocacy behaviours

| Royalty relief | NPV of hypothetical brand licence royalties | M&A, balance sheet |
| Interbrand methodology | Brand strength score × earnings attributable to brand | Public brand rankings |
| BrandZ (Kantar) | Consumer value + loyalty data-driven brand valuation | Public brand rankings |
| Economic use | Earnings attributable to brand × brand multiple | Internal valuation |

## Brand Tracking Framework

A best-practice brand tracking survey should cover:

1. **Category level** — category salience, penetration trends
2. **Awareness** — unaided recall, aided awareness
3. **Consideration** — inclusion in consideration set
4. **Associations** — 10–15 key attributes rated on brand and competitors
5. **Perceived quality** — overall quality, vs. price paid
6. **Loyalty** — repurchase intent, NPS, recommendation
7. **Usage** — actual purchase/usage frequency

Track all measures over time (monthly or quarterly) and always vs. key competitors.

## Red Flag Metrics

| Metric | Directional Warning |
|---|---|
| Falling unaided recall | Salience erosion |
| Declining price premium | Equity dilution or commoditisation |
| Rising price sensitivity | Weakening perceived quality |
| Declining consideration | Relevance gap |
| NPS decline | Trust or satisfaction problem |
| Rising share of promotional volume | Over-reliance on price activation |
