# PDF Summaries — Brand Equity

## 1. Keller (1993) — "Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity"
**File:** docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Keller (1993).pdf
**Journal:** Journal of Marketing, 57(1), 1–22

The foundational paper for CBBE. Keller defines brand equity as the differential effect of brand knowledge on consumer response to brand marketing. Introduces brand knowledge as an associative network comprising two components: brand awareness (recognition + recall) and brand image (associations rated on favourability, strength, uniqueness). Provides the conceptual foundation for all subsequent CBBE research. Emphasises that both depth and breadth of awareness matter.

## 2. Keller (2001) — "Building Customer-Based Brand Equity"
**File:** docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Keller 2001 Customer_Basedbrand_Equity_Model.pdf
**Publication:** Marketing Management, 10(2), 28–37

Builds on the 1993 paper to propose the CBBE pyramid — a four-level model of brand building from salience at the base to resonance at the peak. Introduces the six brand-building blocks: salience, performance, imagery, judgments, feelings, resonance. The pyramid is now the standard framework for teaching brand equity. Practical blueprint for sequencing brand-building investments.

## 3. Customer_Based_Brand_Equity.pdf
**File:** docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Customer_Based_Brand_Equity.pdf

An accessible treatment of CBBE principles, likely a practitioner-oriented summary or working paper version of Keller's framework. Covers the same conceptual territory: brand knowledge, the associative memory model, sources of CBBE, and implications for managing brands.

## 4. Feldwick (1996) — "What Is Brand Equity Anyway, and How Do You Measure It?"
**File:** docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/feldwick-1996-what-is-brand-equity-anyway.pdf
**Journal:** Journal of the Market Research Society, 38(2), 85–104

A seminal critique and clarification. Feldwick argues that "brand equity" conflates three distinct concepts: (1) brand strength / loyalty, (2) brand value / financial worth, and (3) brand description / associations. Provides a taxonomy of measurement approaches for each strand. Warns against treating a single number as a valid measure of brand equity. Highly practical for market researchers and brand managers.

## 5. Barwise (1993) — "Brand Equity: Snark or Boojum?"
**File:** docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Brand-equity-Snark-or-boojum_1993.pdf
**Journal:** International Journal of Research in Marketing, 10(1), 93–104

A provocative paper that asks whether brand equity is a useful construct or an empty concept. Barwise uses Lewis Carroll's metaphors: a Snark is valuable and real; a Boojum vanishes when you approach it. Concludes that brand equity is real and intuitive, but single-number measures are misleading and unreliable. Advocates for longitudinal multi-metric tracking rather than any single "brand equity score."

## 6. Hoeffler & Keller (2003) — "Building Brand Equity Through Corporate Societal Marketing"
**File:** docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Hoeffler & Keller (2003).pdf
**Journal:** Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 22(1), 78–89

Examines how cause-related marketing and CSR activities build brand equity. Identifies six ways CSR builds equity: differentiating associations, building credibility, evoking feelings, creating community (resonance), enabling positive self-concept, and providing a reason to choose. Also warns about "cause washing" — CSR that appears insincere damages credibility. Most effective when the cause is relevant, commitment is long-term, and the association is unique to the brand.

## 7. Trust_BE_Ambler.pdf — Ambler on Trust and Brand Equity
**File:** docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/Trust_BE_Ambler.pdf
**Author:** Tim Ambler

Tim Ambler's work on brand equity emphasises the relational dimension — particularly trust. Argues that trust is the relational core of brand equity, accumulated slowly through consistent delivery and lost quickly through failures or inconsistencies. Trust-based equity is durable and hard to replicate. Bridges the gap between the cognitive (CBBE) and relational (loyalty) views of brand equity.

## 8. BRAND_EQUITY_DILUTION_KELLER.pdf
**File:** docs/newskills/07_Brand_Equity/BRAND_EQUITY_DILUTION_KELLER.pdf

Examines the conditions under which brand equity is diluted — specifically through brand extensions. Identifies extension fit, extension success/failure, and the direction of transfer (parent to extension vs. extension feedback to parent) as key variables. Shows that failed extensions in low-fit categories cause significant parent brand damage. Provides a framework for extension risk assessment before proceeding with new brand extensions.
