## Feldwick's Three Strands of Brand Equity

Paul Feldwick argues that "brand equity" is used to mean three distinct things, and conflating them causes confusion:

### Strand 1: Brand Strength (Loyalty Measure)
- The degree to which customers consistently choose the brand over alternatives
- Measured behaviourally (share of requirements, switching rates, repeat purchase)
- Operationally useful for tracking brand health

### Strand 2: Brand Value (Financial Asset)
- The total monetary value of the brand as an intangible asset
- Used in: mergers & acquisitions, balance sheet reporting, licensing
- Methods: royalty relief, economic use method, historical cost, market comparison

### Strand 3: Brand Description (Associations / Image)
- The set of associations, beliefs, and attitudes consumers hold toward the brand
- This is brand image — not a number, but a qualitative profile
- Measured with: brand image studies, perceptual mapping, association research

**Key insight**: These three strands are related but not the same thing. A brand can have strong associations but weak loyalty. A brand can have high financial value but declining loyalty.

## The "Snark or Boojum" Debate (Barwise, 1993)

Barwise's provocative 1993 paper questioned whether brand equity was:
- A useful management concept (**Snark** — real and valuable)
- An illusory concept with no solid empirical grounding (**Boojum** — chases you away when found)

Barwise's conclusions:
1. Brand equity is real and managers know it when they see it
2. But single-number measures of equity are unreliable
3. The most practical approach is multi-metric tracking over time
4. Relative market share is one of the best proxies for brand equity

## Financial Valuation Methods

### Royalty Relief Method
- Estimate what a brand owner would pay in royalties to license the brand from a third party
- Net present value of notional royalty payments = brand value
- Widely used by Interbrand, Brand Finance

### Economic Use / Earnings Split
- Calculate how much of a company's earnings are attributable to the brand (vs. other assets)
- Multiply by a brand multiple based on brand strength
- Used by Interbrand's ranking methodology

### Historical Cost
- What has been spent to build the brand?
- Rarely used because historical spend ≠ current value

### Market Comparison
- Comparable transaction multiples from brand acquisitions
- Useful as a benchmark check

## Financial Equity and Marketing ROI

Financial brand equity provides a bridge between marketing investment and shareholder value:
- Brands built over time create stock of intangible value
- This stock protects against competitive entry (price umbrella)
- Financial equity justifies continued marketing investment to CFOs

## Limitations of Financial Approaches

- Financial brand value is an estimate, not a fact
- Different methodologies produce wildly different numbers for the same brand
- Financial value is retrospective; CBBE is forward-looking
- Neither financial nor customer-based equity alone is sufficient — both matter
