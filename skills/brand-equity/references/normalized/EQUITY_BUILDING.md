## Core Equity-Building Principles

Brand equity is built through brand knowledge — by creating the right types of memories with the right consumers. Three pathways:

1. **Direct experience** — Product use and service encounters
2. **Marketing communications** — Advertising, sponsorship, events
3. **Word of mouth and social influence** — Advocacy and peer endorsement

## Marketing Advantages of Strong Brands (Hoeffler & Keller, 2003)

Brands with strong CBBE have measurable advantages:

| Advantage | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Greater loyalty | Strong associations → habitual choice |
| Less vulnerability to competitive attack | Deep associations are harder to dislodge |
| Larger margins | Willingness to pay premium |
| Greater trade cooperation | Retailers prefer stocking strong brands |
| Increased marketing effectiveness | Strong brands get more attention per ad dollar |
| Extension opportunities | Equity transfers to new categories |
| Better crisis resilience | Trust buffer absorbs negative events |

## Equity Building Through Corporate Societal Marketing (CSR)

Hoeffler & Keller (2003) identify how cause-related marketing and CSR build brand equity:

**CSR associations build equity through:**
- **Differentiation** — CSR creates an association competitors can't easily copy
- **Credibility** — A brand with visible values is seen as more trustworthy
- **Feelings** — CSR generates warmth and admiration (emotional associations)
- **Resonance** — Shared values create community and loyalty

**Conditions for CSR to build equity effectively:**
1. The cause must be relevant to the brand and its customers
2. The commitment must be long-term and visible, not opportunistic
3. The association must be distinctive — not a generic "green" or "charity" claim
4. Customers must perceive the CSR as genuine, not PR-driven

**Risk**: If CSR is perceived as "cause washing" or inconsistent with the brand's behaviour, it can damage credibility and create negative associations.

## Brand-Building Through Associations

**Creating strong associations:**
- Repetition builds strength (long-term, consistent messaging)
- Emotional relevance builds strength (associations tied to emotions are stronger)
- Self-congruity builds strength (associations that match the consumer's self-image)

**Creating favourable associations:**
- Associations must deliver real functional or symbolic value
- Endorsements from credible sources (celebrities, institutions, certifications)

**Creating unique associations:**
- Points of difference must be genuinely different from what competitors own
- Uniqueness is tested by asking: "Does this association help discriminate our brand from others?"

## Long-Run vs. Short-Run Brand Building

Brand equity is a stock that accumulates slowly and depletes quickly:
- Long-term consistency in positioning builds strong, deep associations
- Short-term tactical changes (price promotions, repositioning) can erode associations
- The ratio of brand-building (long-term) to sales activation (short-term) advertising matters

**IPA / Binet & Field finding** (related): ~60% brand-building to 40% activation is optimal for long-term growth.

## Trust as the Foundation (Ambler)

Tim Ambler argues that trust is the relational core of brand equity:
- Trust is built through consistent delivery over time
- Trust accelerates word of mouth and reduces consideration effort
- Brands with high trust are chosen under conditions of uncertainty
- Trust is not easily quantified but is detectable through NPS, advocacy metrics, and switching rates
