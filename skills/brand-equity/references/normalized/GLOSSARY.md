# Brand Equity — Glossary

**Brand Equity**
The differential effect that brand knowledge has on consumer response to the marketing of that brand. Positive equity = consumers respond more favourably because of the brand name.

**CBBE (Customer-Based Brand Equity)**
Keller's framework locating brand equity in the minds of customers, built from brand knowledge (awareness + image) and measured at four pyramid levels: salience → performance/imagery → judgments/feelings → resonance.

**Brand Salience**
The degree to which the brand is thought of in buying situations; includes both depth (ease of recall) and breadth (range of situations).

**Brand Awareness**
Consumers' ability to identify a brand under different conditions. Two forms: recognition (aided, at-shelf) and recall (unaided, from memory).

**Brand Image**
The set of associations linked to the brand in consumer memory; includes attributes, benefits, and attitudes.

**Brand Associations**
Anything linked in memory to a brand node. Evaluated on favourability, strength, and uniqueness.

**Brand Knowledge**
The totality of brand associations in consumer memory, structured as an associative network.

**Brand Resonance**
The highest level of CBBE — a deep, loyal, active relationship between consumer and brand. Characterised by behavioural loyalty, attitudinal attachment, community, and active engagement.

**Brand Strength**
Feldwick Strand 1: the degree of consumer loyalty/repeat purchase; behavioural loyalty as a proxy for equity.

**Brand Value**
Feldwick Strand 2: the financial monetary worth of the brand as a business asset; used in M&A and balance sheet accounting.

**Brand Description**
Feldwick Strand 3: the qualitative profile of brand associations, personality, and image.

**Equity Dilution**
The weakening or blurring of brand associations resulting from inconsistent communications, failed extensions, overextension, quality failures, or price discounting.

**Price Premium**
The additional amount consumers pay for a branded product vs. an equivalent unbranded or generic product; a direct measure of brand equity.

**Perceived Quality**
Consumer's overall judgement about the excellence of a product or service; a core component of CBBE at the Judgments level.

**Brand Loyalty**
The tendency of consumers to consistently choose a brand over alternatives; includes both behavioural (repeat purchase) and attitudinal (commitment, advocacy) dimensions.

**NPS (Net Promoter Score)**
A measure of brand advocacy: % promoters minus % detractors on a "how likely to recommend?" scale.

**Royalty Relief**
A brand valuation method calculating the NPV of royalties that would be paid to license the brand from a third party.

**Share of Requirements (SOR)**
The proportion of a consumer's category purchases accounted for by a specific brand; a behavioural loyalty metric.

**Secondary Brand Associations**
Equity transferred to a brand by linking it to other entities: companies, countries, celebrities, events, or other brands.

**Brand Tracking**
Continuous measurement of key brand equity metrics (awareness, consideration, associations, quality, loyalty) over time vs. competitors.

**Trust (brand)**
Ambler: the relational core of brand equity; accumulated through consistent delivery, lost quickly through failures; drives choice under uncertainty.

**Brand Resonance Model**
Alternative name for Keller's CBBE pyramid when described from the resonance outcome perspective.

**Interbrand Methodology**
A proprietary brand valuation approach combining brand strength scores with earnings attributable to the brand to produce a financial valuation.
