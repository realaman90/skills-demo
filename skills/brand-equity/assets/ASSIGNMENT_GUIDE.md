# ASSIGNMENT GUIDE: Brand Equity

## Your role vs. the AI's role

**You** diagnose the brand's equity. **The skill** gives you the instruments.

The skill knows Keller's CBBE pyramid, Feldwick's three strands, RepTrak dimensions, and every concept in the course notes. What it cannot do is assess the specific brand you've chosen — its actual awareness levels, the associations consumers hold, its price premium, its loyalty metrics. That requires data and your analytical judgement.

## What this skill covers

- Keller's CBBE pyramid: Salience → Performance + Imagery → Judgments + Feelings → Resonance
- Brand knowledge: awareness (recall + recognition) and image (associations: favourability × strength × uniqueness)
- Feldwick's three strands: brand strength (loyalty), brand value (financial), brand description (image)
- Barwise's critique: why single-number equity scores are unreliable
- Equity building: how to build strong, favourable, unique associations
- Equity dilution: what erodes brand equity and how to protect it

## Before you open the skill

Do this yourself first — before any framework:

1. Rate the brand's salience in its category: Does it come to mind quickly and in many buying situations, or is recall narrow and slow?
2. List the top 5 associations consumers hold for this brand. Are they favourable? Strong? Unique to this brand?
3. Identify one association the brand owns that no competitor could credibly claim.
4. Identify one association the brand wishes it owned but doesn't yet.
5. Apply Feldwick: what is the brand's loyalty position (brand strength)? Its premium vs. category (brand value)? Its distinctive image profile (brand description)?

## Suggested workflow

1. Complete your own equity assessment across Feldwick's three strands — write a paragraph on each
2. Use the skill in **learn mode**: share your assessment and ask it to probe gaps using the CBBE pyramid
3. Use **diagnose mode** to map the full CBBE pyramid for your brand
4. Use **measure mode** to identify what data you would need to validate your assessment
5. Use **protect mode** if your diagnosis reveals dilution risks
6. Write your assignment — cite Keller (1993), Keller (2001), and Feldwick (1996)

## What the skill will probe you on (learn mode)

- At which level of the CBBE pyramid is the brand weakest?
- Are the brand's associations genuinely favourable, strong, AND unique — or just one of the three?
- Is your equity assessment based on evidence or assumption? What data supports each claim?
- Where is the biggest dilution risk?
- What is the single most important equity-building investment this brand should make?

---

## What your examiner will ask

- "Apply the CBBE pyramid to this brand. At which level is the brand weakest and what is the evidence?"
- "Identify three brand associations. Rate each on favourability, strength, and uniqueness. What does this tell you about the brand's equity position?"
- "Apply Feldwick's three strands. What does each strand reveal that the others miss?"
- "What is the most significant equity dilution risk for this brand? How would you address it?"
- "Design a brand tracking programme for this brand. What would you measure, how often, and what thresholds would trigger action?"

## Academic integrity note

The CBBE pyramid rating and association mapping in your assignment must be grounded in observable evidence — consumer research data, brand tracking reports, competitive benchmarks, advertising content analysis. Ratings without evidence are assertions, not analysis.
