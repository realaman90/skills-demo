# POSITIONING_PROCESS

## Step-by-Step Brand Positioning Process

---

### Phase 1: Understand the Current State

**Step 1 — Audit current brand perception**
- What do consumers currently believe the brand is? (Unaided awareness, associations, perception surveys)
- What position does the brand currently occupy — or fail to occupy?
- Where do consumers place the brand relative to competitors on key category attributes?

**Step 2 — Map the competitive landscape**
- List all direct and indirect competitors.
- Identify the position each competitor owns (the concept/word/idea they own in buyer minds).
- Build a perceptual map: plot brands on 2 axes representing the most important category attributes.
- Identify: What positions are taken? What positions are open? Where is there overlap and undifferentiation?

**Step 3 — Understand the target market**
- Who is the primary target? What job are they trying to do (link to JTBD framework)?
- What do they currently value in the category? What are their unmet needs?
- Which brands do they currently choose, and why?

### Phase 2: Define the Positioning

**Step 4 — Choose the frame of reference**
- What competitive set are you entering? Narrow (specific sub-category) or broad (wide category)?
- The frame of reference determines who the competition is and what POPs are required.
- Choose a frame that is: large enough to be meaningful, small enough to win, and honest about the category you're in.

**Step 5 — Identify category POPs**
- What must the brand match to be considered a credible player in the chosen frame of reference?
- List all category POPs — price range, core features, service standards, quality signals.
- Confirm the brand delivers on all category POPs — deficiencies here must be fixed before PODs can work.

**Step 6 — Identify and select PODs**
- Brainstorm all candidate PODs: functional, emotional, process, service, experience.
- Test each against Keller's three criteria: Desirable, Deliverable, Differentiating.
- Select 1–3 strongest PODs — avoid diluting positioning by claiming too many.
- Build Reasons to Believe (RTBs) for each POD: what evidence or proof supports this claim?

**Step 7 — Check for POP-POD conflicts**
- Does the claimed POD inadvertently suggest weakness on a category POP?
  - e.g., "The most affordable option" (POD) implies "probably lower quality" (POP violation).
- Resolve conflicts by: reframing the POD, providing explicit reassurance on the POP, or choosing a different POD.

### Phase 3: Articulate the Positioning

**Step 8 — Write the positioning statement**
Format: "To [target market], [Brand] is the [frame of reference] that [POD] because [RTB]."
- Keep it internal — the positioning statement is a strategic tool, not consumer-facing copy.
- It should be specific enough to guide decisions, not vague enough to mean anything.

**Step 9 — Develop the brand mantra** (optional but recommended)
- Distil the positioning into a 3–5 word mantra using Keller's three-component framework.
- Test: does it communicate, simplify, and inspire?

**Step 10 — Build the positioning platform**
- Expand the positioning statement into a fuller brief covering: target market profile, frame of reference rationale, PODs with RTBs, POPs to be established, mantra, and tone of voice guidance.

### Phase 4: Implement and Protect

**Step 11 — Translate positioning to all touchpoints**
- Brief advertising, product, customer experience, packaging, and digital teams against the positioning.
- Every touchpoint should reinforce PODs and not undermine POPs.

**Step 12 — Track positioning over time**
- Run periodic positioning audits: perceptual maps, consumer association surveys.
- Monitor competitive positioning shifts — are competitors moving into your position?
- Measure: POD attribute associations, frame of reference awareness, positioning distinctiveness.

**Step 13 — Resist repositioning without cause**
- Positioning takes years to establish — changing it without strong strategic reason destroys equity.
- Only reposition when: the category has fundamentally changed, the current position is occupied by a stronger competitor, or a new, larger opportunity requires a new frame of reference.
