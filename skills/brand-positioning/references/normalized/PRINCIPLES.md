### What Is Brand Positioning?
- Brand positioning is the act of designing the company's offering and image to occupy a distinctive place in the target market's mind.
- The goal: to create a unique, clear, desirable place in the mind of the target customer relative to competing brands.
- Positioning is not what you do to the product — it is what you do to the mind of the prospect.
- A well-positioned brand has a clear answer to: "Why should I, in your target market, choose your brand, given all the alternatives available?"

### The Three Core Positioning Questions (Keller)
1. **"Who are you?"** — The frame of reference: what category or competitive set are you competing in?
2. **"What are you?"** — Category membership: what benefits does the brand deliver that earn it a legitimate place in the category?
3. **"Why should I choose you?"** — Points of Difference: what do you offer that competitors don't, in a way that matters to the target customer?

### Why Positioning Matters
- Without clear positioning, the brand is defined by the market — or worse, not defined at all.
- Positioning guides every downstream decision: advertising, pricing, distribution, product development, partnerships.
- Consistent positioning builds the memory structures that drive mental availability (see `mental-availability-cep` skill).
- Clear positioning makes resource allocation decisions easier — it defines what the brand should and should not do.

### Positioning vs. Image vs. Identity
- **Positioning**: The intended competitive place the brand seeks to occupy in the target's mind — relative to alternatives.
- **Brand identity**: The full set of associations the brand intends to create (Kapferer's prism).
- **Brand image**: The actual perceptions held by consumers — may differ from intended positioning.
- Positioning is the strategic intent; identity is the full self-concept; image is the market reality.

### The Positioning Hierarchy
1. **Corporate positioning**: The overarching position of the parent company.
2. **Brand positioning**: The position of individual brands within the corporate portfolio.
3. **Product/sub-brand positioning**: The position of specific products or lines within a brand.
- Each level should be consistent — but lower levels can be more specific and targeted.

### Positioning Must Be Earned, Not Just Claimed
- Positioning a brand as the "most innovative" requires actual innovation — not just marketing language.
- Unearned positioning claims are quickly rejected by consumers and damage credibility.
- Positioning should be both aspirational (where the brand wants to be) and grounded (what the brand genuinely delivers today).
