### The Core Idea: Own a Word in the Mind
- Positioning is not about the product — it is about what you do to the mind of the prospect.
- The most powerful positioning strategy is to own a single concept (a word, an idea) in the prospect's mind.
- When buyers think of that concept, they should think of your brand first — and exclusively.
- Examples: Volvo = Safety. FedEx = Overnight delivery. Google = Search. Domino's = 30-minute delivery.
- The power of positioning comes from simplicity and focus — one idea, one brand.

### The First-Mover Principle
- The first brand to occupy a position in the mind has a massive and durable advantage.
- Buyers' minds tend to lock in the first brand they associate with a concept — later entrants must dislodge that association, which is extremely difficult.
- Implication: being first to stake out a position is often more valuable than being objectively superior.
- If you can't be first in the category, create a new category where you can be first.

### The Mental Ladder
- Buyers store brands in ranked hierarchies ("ladders") in their minds — one for each product category.
- The top rung is the most salient brand; lower rungs are also-rans.
- It is very hard to move up a ladder — easier to create a new ladder (new category or sub-category).
- A brand on rung 2 should position against the leader to benefit from the leader's mental prominence.
- Example: Avis ("We're No. 2. We try harder.") — leveraged the mental ladder rather than fighting it.

### Repositioning Competitors
- If you cannot find an open position, create one by repositioning a competitor in the mind.
- Show consumers that the competitor's claimed strength is actually a weakness — or that the competitor no longer deserves its position.
- Repositioning is aggressive: it requires directly challenging competitor claims with credible counter-evidence.
- Legal and ethical boundaries apply — claims must be substantiable.

### Finding the Open Position
- Scan the market for unoccupied mental positions — concepts that no brand owns.
- The open position must be: relevant to buyers, believable for the brand, and sustainable against competitive response.
- Niche positions can be valuable when the niche is large enough and well-defined.
- A position is "open" when no existing brand is strongly and exclusively linked to it in buyers' minds.

### The Dangers of Line Extension
- Ries & Trout argued strongly against line extension — applying a successful brand name to new products weakens the original position.
- Every new product added to a brand name dilutes the mental concept the brand owns.
- "Coke" works as long as it means one thing. "Coke Diet", "Coke Zero", "Coke Energy" — each extension blurs the mental concept.
- Separate brand names for separate positions are stronger than umbrella branding across different positions.

### Repositioning Your Own Brand
Triggers for repositioning:
- Category is declining and the brand needs to move to a new frame of reference.
- A new, larger opportunity has emerged adjacent to the current position.
- The current position is being occupied by a stronger competitor.
- Changing consumer behaviour has made the current position less relevant.

Repositioning process:
1. Acknowledge the current position honestly — what does the market think you are?
2. Identify the target position — what concept do you want to own?
3. Build a bridge from current to target — find the credible narrative linking old and new.
4. Commit fully — half-hearted repositioning leaves the brand stranded between two positions.
5. Allow time — repositioning takes years, not months.
