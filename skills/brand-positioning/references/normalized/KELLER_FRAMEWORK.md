### The Four Components of Keller's Positioning Model

**1. Target Market**
- Who is the brand for? Define specifically — not "everyone" or "adults 25–54".
- Include: demographics (minimal), psychographics (values, lifestyle), behavioural characteristics (usage occasion, purchase drivers), and importantly — the job they are trying to do (link to JTBD).
- A well-defined target market makes the subsequent positioning choices more concrete and defensible.
- Note: targeting does not mean excluding — it means the positioning is optimised for this segment. Others may still buy.

**2. Frame of Reference (Competitive Frame)**
- What is the category or competitive set the brand is being evaluated against?
- The frame of reference tells the customer what the brand is — establishing category membership.
- Choosing the right frame of reference is strategic: a narrow frame (e.g., "premium B2B software") vs. a broad frame (e.g., "business transformation partner") changes who the competition is and what the PODs need to be.
- Category membership cues: price, distribution, product design, category signals in advertising.

**3. Points of Difference (PODs)**
- The attributes or benefits consumers strongly associate with the brand, positively evaluate, and believe they could not find to the same extent with a competing brand.
- PODs must pass three criteria:
  - **Desirable**: Consumers must care about the POD — it must matter in the purchase decision.
  - **Deliverable**: The brand must actually be able to deliver the POD — it must be grounded in reality.
  - **Differentiating**: The POD must be genuinely different from what competitors offer — not just claimed difference.
- Types of PODs:
  - Functional PODs: Performance, reliability, speed, range.
  - Emotional PODs: Status, confidence, belonging, excitement.
  - Process PODs: How the brand delivers (service model, customisation, speed of response).

**4. Points of Parity (POPs)**
- Associations that are not necessarily unique to the brand, but are necessary to establish category credibility.
- Two types:
  - **Category POPs**: Must-haves to be considered a legitimate player in the category. If missing, the brand is disqualified before PODs can matter.
    - Example: A bank must be perceived as secure to enter the category. Security is a POP — not a POD.
  - **Competitive POPs**: Designed to neutralise a competitor's POD. If a competitor claims speed, matching speed makes their advantage irrelevant and frees the brand to compete on its own POD.
- **The POP-POD balance**: Strong PODs often create a perceived POP weakness. Fix these by:
  - Showing the apparent trade-off doesn't exist ("we're both X and Y")
  - Reassuring on the POP through proof points
  - Sacrificing the POP strategically if the target doesn't value it

### Writing the Positioning Statement
Standard format:
> **To [target market], [brand] is the [frame of reference] that [point of difference] because [reason to believe].**

Example:
> "To growing mid-market businesses, Acme CRM is the customer management platform that gives sales teams real-time pipeline visibility because our AI surfaces the deals most at risk before they slip."

Components:
- **Target market**: "growing mid-market businesses"
- **Frame of reference**: "customer management platform"
- **Point of difference**: "real-time pipeline visibility"
- **Reason to believe**: "AI surfaces deals most at risk before they slip"

### Choosing and Justifying PODs
Step 1 — Brainstorm candidate PODs: What does the brand do better than anyone else? What do customers say they can't get elsewhere?

Step 2 — Test against three criteria:
- Would this matter to the target market? (Desirability)
- Can we genuinely deliver it? (Deliverability)
- Can competitors easily replicate it? (Differentiation sustainability)

Step 3 — Identify the strongest 1–3 PODs (more than 3 dilutes positioning).

Step 4 — Build reasons to believe (RTBs) for each POD — claims need evidence.

Step 5 — Check for POP gaps: Does claiming the POD inadvertently suggest weakness on a category basic?
