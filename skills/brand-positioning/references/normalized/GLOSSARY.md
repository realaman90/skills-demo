## Brand Positioning Terminology

### Brand Positioning
The act of designing the brand's offering and image to occupy a distinctive, desirable place in the target market's mind relative to competing brands. Defined by Keller as answering: "Why should I, in the target market, choose this brand?"

### Frame of Reference (Competitive Frame)
The competitive set or category the brand is positioning itself within. Defines who the competitors are and what Points of Parity are required for credibility.

### Point of Difference (POD)
An attribute or benefit consumers strongly associate with the brand, positively evaluate, and believe they cannot find to the same extent from a competing brand. Must be Desirable, Deliverable, and Differentiating.

### Point of Parity (POP)
An association that is not unique to the brand but is necessary to establish legitimate category membership. Two types: Category POPs (must-haves for any brand in the category) and Competitive POPs (designed to neutralise a competitor's POD).

### Reason to Believe (RTB)
Evidence or proof that supports a Point of Difference claim. Without RTBs, PODs are unsubstantiated assertions. RTBs can be: product features, third-party endorsements, data, testimonials, or demonstration.

### Positioning Statement
An internal strategic document articulating brand positioning: "To [target market], [Brand] is the [frame of reference] that [POD] because [RTB]." Not for consumer use — it is a strategic compass for internal teams.

### Brand Mantra
A 3–5 word internal phrase capturing the irrefutable essence of brand positioning. Components: Brand Function + Descriptive Modifier + Emotional Modifier. Must communicate, simplify, and inspire (Keller's three criteria).

### Perceptual Map
A two-dimensional visual plot of how consumers perceive brands in a category on key attributes. Used to identify competitive positions, open positions, and positioning opportunities.

### Mental Ladder (Ries & Trout)
The ranked hierarchy of brands buyers store in memory for each product category. The top-rung brand is the most salient. Extremely difficult to move up a ladder — easier to create a new ladder.

### First-Mover Positioning Advantage
The durable advantage accrued by the first brand to occupy a mental position (concept/word) in buyers' minds. Later entrants must displace deeply embedded associations — a very difficult task.

### Differentiation
The process of designing meaningful, perceivable, and sustainable differences between the brand and competitors on attributes buyers value. Classical positioning strategy — challenged by Romaniuk et al. empirical evidence.

### Distinctiveness
Being easily recognised and identified as the brand through Distinctive Brand Assets — a perceptual/memory concept. Different from differentiation, which is evaluative. Both are needed; distinctiveness builds salience, differentiation builds preference.

### Line Extension Risk (Ries & Trout)
The dilution of a brand's mental position that occurs when the brand name is applied to new, disparate products. Each extension weakens the clarity and focus of the original position.

### Repositioning
The deliberate change of a brand's competitive position in buyers' minds — either to a new frame of reference, a new POD, or a new target market. Requires time (years), full commitment, and a credible bridge from the old to the new position.

### Category Membership
The signals a brand sends to establish that it is a legitimate player in a given competitive frame of reference. Communicated through price, distribution, product design, and advertising cues.
