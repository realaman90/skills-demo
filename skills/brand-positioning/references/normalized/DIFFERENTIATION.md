### The Classical Definition of Differentiation
- Differentiation is the process of designing meaningful differences that distinguish a company's offering from competitors.
- Classical positioning theory (Porter, Trout) frames differentiation as the primary source of competitive advantage.
- A differentiated brand occupies a unique position in the market — it competes on a dimension where it is clearly superior.
- Types of differentiation:
  - **Product differentiation**: Superior features, performance, reliability, design.
  - **Service differentiation**: Delivery speed, expertise, customisation, responsiveness.
  - **Channel differentiation**: Unique distribution, convenience, accessibility.
  - **Image differentiation**: Brand personality, associations, status signals.
  - **Price differentiation**: Premium or value positioning relative to alternatives.

### The Evidence-Based Challenge to Differentiation-Led Strategy
- Romaniuk et al. (2007) found that perceived brand differentiation is weakly and inconsistently correlated with brand performance.
- Consumers in most categories do not perceive brands as markedly different — even when brands have invested heavily in differentiation strategies.
- High-share brands are not consistently perceived as more different — they are more salient and more widely distributed.
- Implication: differentiation is necessary but not sufficient for growth. Salience and availability matter at least as much.

### Ritson's Balanced View
- Ritson argues that both differentiation and salience matter — the question is the right balance for the brand's situation.
- Salience (mental availability) is the prerequisite: if buyers don't think of the brand, differentiation is irrelevant.
- Differentiation matters most at the evaluation stage — once a brand is considered, difference may influence preference.
- Brands that invest only in salience without any differentiation are at risk of commoditisation.
- Brands that invest only in differentiation without salience are invisible.

### When Differentiation Delivers Real Value
Differentiation is most effective when:
1. **The difference is perceptible to buyers** — they can actually notice and experience the difference.
2. **The difference matters in the purchase decision** — it is important to buyers, not just to the brand.
3. **The difference is sustainable** — competitors cannot easily copy it.
4. **The difference is credible** — buyers believe the brand can actually deliver it.

Differentiation that is claimed but not perceptible, important, sustainable, or credible delivers little value.

### Differentiation vs. Distinctiveness (Sharp / Ehrenberg-Bass)
- **Differentiation**: Being perceived as different on attributes buyers value — a cognitive and evaluative concept.
- **Distinctiveness**: Being easily recognised and identified as the brand — a perceptual and memory-based concept.
- Both are valuable but work differently:
  - Distinctiveness builds salience and aids recognition at point of purchase.
  - Differentiation builds preference at the evaluation stage.
- A brand can be highly distinctive without being differentiated (recognisable but not better-or-different).
- A brand can be differentiated but not distinctive (genuinely better but not easily identified or recalled).
- Brands need both — but distinctiveness is often the more neglected of the two.

### Practical Positioning Implications
- Don't position solely on "we are different" — position on what the difference means for the buyer.
- The POD must translate into a buyer benefit: not "we have 50,000 integrations" but "you connect everything you already use in one afternoon."
- Stress-test every claimed POD: Is this difference perceptible? Does it matter? Can we sustain it?
- Combine differentiation strategy with salience investment — neither alone is sufficient.
