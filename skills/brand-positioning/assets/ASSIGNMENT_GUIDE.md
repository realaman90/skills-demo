# ASSIGNMENT GUIDE: Brand Positioning

## Your role vs. the AI's role

**You** make the strategic positioning choice. **The skill** tests whether it holds.

Any AI can write a positioning statement that sounds good. The hard part — which only you can do — is making the trade-offs: choosing a frame of reference narrow enough to win, selecting PODs that are genuinely defensible, and deciding what the brand must give up to own a position.

## What this skill covers

- Keller's positioning framework: target, frame of reference, points of difference (POD), points of parity (POP), reasons to believe
- Ries & Trout: positioning as a mental battle, the ladder principle, repositioning competitors
- Brand mantras: the 3-word essence of a brand's positioning
- Differentiation: what actually makes a difference vs. what is merely different
- Positioning process: consumer insight → competitive analysis → positioning statement → mantra

## Before you open the skill

Do this without AI assistance first:

1. Write a rough positioning statement in this format: "For [target], [brand] is the only [frame of reference] that [POD] because [reason to believe]."
2. List your brand's top 3 PODs. Now ask: could a competitor credibly claim any of these tomorrow? If yes, it's not a real POD.
3. List the POPs — the category requirements the brand must meet to even be considered. Don't confuse these with PODs.
4. What is the brand's frame of reference? Is it too broad (competing against everything) or too narrow (limiting growth)?
5. What would the brand have to give up or stop doing to fully own this position?

## Suggested workflow

1. Complete your draft positioning statement and POD/POP analysis independently
2. Use the skill in **learn mode**: submit your statement and ask it to stress-test the logic
3. Use **define mode** to formalise the positioning using the full Keller framework
4. Use **competitive mode** to check whether the position is genuinely differentiated vs. competitors
5. Use **mantra mode** to distil it to a 3-word brand mantra
6. Write your assignment — cite Keller, Ries & Trout, and Kapferer as appropriate

## What the skill will probe you on (learn mode)

- Is your POD actually differentiating, or is it a POP (table stakes)?
- Is the frame of reference appropriate — does it help or limit the brand?
- Could a competitor make the exact same positioning claim? If yes, why does your brand own it?
- Is there a genuine reason to believe — or is the RTB just an assertion?
- What must the brand sacrifice to commit to this position?

---

## What your examiner will ask

- "Write the positioning statement. Identify the target, frame of reference, PODs, POPs, and RTBs explicitly."
- "Is the primary POD truly differentiating? What evidence from the competitive landscape supports that claim?"
- "Apply Ries & Trout's ladder principle — where is this brand on the mental ladder relative to competitors?"
- "What is the brand mantra? Evaluate it against Keller's three criteria: communicate, simplify, inspire."
- "What would you recommend the brand stop communicating in order to sharpen this position?"

## Academic integrity note

A positioning statement generated by AI and submitted as your own work is a positioning statement with no strategic thinking behind it. Your examiner will probe your reasoning in the oral component or in follow-up questions. Know your trade-offs, know your evidence, know what you chose not to say and why.
