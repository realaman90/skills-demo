## Key Frameworks

1. **Distinctive Assets Grid (DAG)** (Romaniuk): Fame × Uniqueness → Defend / Invest / Avoid / Ignore
2. **Keller's 6 Criteria**: Memorable | Meaningful | Likable | Transferable | Adaptable | Protectable
3. **Asset Type Taxonomy**: Visual (colour, logo, shape, character) | Verbal (name, tagline, jingle) | Sonic (sonic logo, brand music) | Character (mascots, endorsers)
4. **Cue-to-Brand Retrieval Chain**: Sensory cue → memory activation → brand node retrieval → consideration
5. **Consistency Compounding**: Fame builds slowly through repeated consistent deployment; any change resets progress
