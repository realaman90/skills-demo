# Source Quotes — Distinctive Brand Assets

## From Romaniuk — Distinctive Brand Assets

"A Distinctive Brand Asset is any sensory or meaning cue that is uniquely associated with the brand in the minds of buyers. It does not need to be meaningful to be distinctive — it needs to be owned."
(from: docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Distinctive_Brand_Assets.pdf)

"Distinctiveness is not the same as differentiation. Distinctiveness is about being recognisable; differentiation is about being different in a way that matters to consumers. Both are valuable, but they serve different functions."
(from: docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Distinctive_Brand_Assets.pdf)

"The Distinctive Assets Grid helps brands understand which assets are working (high fame and uniqueness), which need investment (high uniqueness, low fame), which are a waste of money (high fame, low uniqueness), and which should be abandoned (low on both)."
(from: docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Distinctive_Brand_Assets.pdf)

"Managers consistently overestimate how well-known and distinctive their brand's assets are. Consumer research almost always reveals a less flattering reality — and that gap is the starting point for DBA strategy."
(from: docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Distinctive_Brand_Assets.pdf)

"Consistency over time is the primary driver of asset fame. Every time an asset is changed, you start the fame-building process again. The cost of change is always higher than it looks."
(from: docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Distinctive_Brand_Assets.pdf)

"The best creative work is built on top of consistent brand cues — not instead of them. The DBA layer must be stable so the creative layer can be fresh."

## From Keller — Brand Elements

"Brand elements are those trademarkable devices that serve to identify and differentiate the brand — they are chosen to build as much brand equity as possible."
(from: docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Brand_Elements_Keller.pdf)

"The brand name is the most important brand element because it often captures the key associations or meaning of the brand and can be used in all marketing communications."
(from: docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Brand_Elements_Keller.pdf)

"Brand elements should be evaluated on six criteria: memorable, meaningful, likable, transferable, adaptable, and protectable. The first three are offensive considerations for building equity; the last three are defensive for protecting equity."
(from: docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Brand_Elements_Keller.pdf)

"Brand characters are particularly valuable because they can convey personality, create warmth and likability, and be consistently deployed across virtually all contexts — making them among the most versatile and memorable brand assets."
(from: docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Brand_Elements_Keller.pdf)

"Slogans are powerful brand elements because they hook back into the brand and help consumers understand what the brand is and makes it special in a memorable way."
(from: docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Brand_Elements_Keller.pdf)
