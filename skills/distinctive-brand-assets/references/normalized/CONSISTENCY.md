# Consistency: The Engine of Distinctive Brand Assets

## Why Consistency Is the Prime Directive

Fame and uniqueness are built through repetition. Every time a consumer encounters a brand asset in context — in advertising, at shelf, on digital — the memory link between the asset and the brand is strengthened. Consistency over time is the single most powerful driver of DBA strength.

**The compounding effect:**
- Year 1: Asset is new; recognition is low; little retrieval happening
- Year 3: Asset is more familiar; early adopters begin to recognise it
- Year 5+: Asset is deeply embedded; recognition is fast and automatic; works even in low-attention contexts

This is why consistency — not creativity — is the engine of DBA building.

## The Consistency Imperative

**Rule 1: Don't change what is working.**
If an asset is in the Defend quadrant (high fame + high uniqueness), it must be preserved. Any change risks:
- Destroying years of accumulated recognition
- Confusing existing buyers
- Requiring re-investment to rebuild lost fame

**Rule 2: Evolution ≠ Replacement.**
Assets can be evolved (modernised, digitised, refined) without losing their distinctive core:
- Logo evolution: maintain the distinctive shape, change the styling
- Character evolution: same character, updated design language
- Sonic evolution: same melody, new production

**Rule 3: Consistency across touchpoints.**
DBAs must appear consistently across ALL channels:
- Advertising (TV, digital, OOH)
- Packaging
- Point of sale / retail
- Website and app
- Social media
- Customer service and experience
- Sponsorships and events

Each inconsistent touchpoint is a missed opportunity to reinforce the asset.

**Rule 4: Consistency over time.**
Creative campaigns can change; DBAs must not. The "creative" layer (executions, storylines, celebrities) can evolve freely. The DBA layer must remain stable underneath.

## The Creative vs. DBA Layer

Think of brand communication in two layers:

| Layer | Changes | Stays |
|---|---|---|
| Creative / Campaign | Execution, story, characters, tone | — |
| DBA Layer | — | Colour, logo, character, sonic, tagline |

Creative agencies tend to be rewarded for novelty — new looks, new ideas, new styles. Left unchecked, agency creative freedom erodes DBA consistency. Brand guidelines and DBA usage rules are the mechanism for protecting the DBA layer.

## DBA Usage Guidelines Checklist

A brand's DBA usage guidelines should specify:

- [ ] Which assets are "must use" in every communication
- [ ] Minimum logo size and placement requirements
- [ ] Approved brand colour palette (exact Pantone / hex codes)
- [ ] Approved and prohibited typefaces
- [ ] Sonic logo inclusion rules for video/audio content
- [ ] Character usage rules (approved poses, expressions, contexts)
- [ ] Tagline inclusion requirements
- [ ] Rules for digital/responsive adaptations of visual assets
- [ ] Process for approving asset evolution proposals

## When Change Is Legitimate

Change to a DBA is warranted when:
1. The asset is in the "Avoid" quadrant (high fame but low uniqueness) — invest in differentiating it
2. The asset has strongly negative connotations (e.g., offensive imagery) — managed evolution is better than abandonment
3. The category has fundamentally shifted (e.g., move to digital-first) — the asset must be adapted to the new context

**Process for legitimate change:**
1. Measure current fame and uniqueness before change
2. Design the evolution to retain the distinctive core
3. Introduce the change gradually with the old and new running together
4. Measure again 12 months post-change to confirm recognition is maintained

## Consistency and Campaign Integration

DBAs must be integrated into campaigns from the brief stage:
- Every campaign brief should include DBA usage as mandatory requirements
- DBAs should appear in the first 3 seconds of video advertising (where attention is highest)
- In digital, where ad-skipping is common, leading with DBAs maximises recognition even on partial views
- In OOH, colour and shape must be visible at distance before the brand name is legible

## The Long Brand Build

Byron Sharp's and Romaniuk's research consistently shows that the brands with the strongest DBAs are those that have used the same assets for the longest time:
- Nike's swoosh: in use since 1971
- Coca-Cola's red: consistent for 140 years
- Intel's sonic logo: in use since 1994

"The most distinctive brands are usually the ones that have been most boring about their brand identity for the longest time." (paraphrase, Romaniuk)
