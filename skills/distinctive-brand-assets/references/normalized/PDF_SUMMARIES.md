**File:** docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Distinctive_Brand_Assets.pdf
**Author:** Jenni Romaniuk (Ehrenberg-Bass Institute)

The primary source for this skill. Romaniuk's framework establishes that brand assets gain their power through uniqueness — their ability to exclusively trigger one brand's retrieval from memory. Introduces the Distinctive Assets Grid (DAG): a 2×2 matrix of Fame × Uniqueness used to audit and prioritise all brand assets. Argues that distinctiveness is separate from and sometimes more important than differentiation in driving brand recall and purchase. Provides the methodology for measuring fame and uniqueness through consumer surveys. Identifies the most common DBA mistakes: changing assets too frequently, using category-generic elements, inconsistent deployment, and managerial over-confidence about asset recognition.

## 2. Brand_Elements_Keller.pdf
**File:** docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Brand_Elements_Keller.pdf
**Author:** Kevin Lane Keller

Keller's complementary framework for brand elements — the formal typology of all trademarkable brand identity components: name, URL, logo, symbol, character, slogan, jingle, and packaging. Evaluates each element type against six criteria: memorable (ease of recall/recognition), meaningful (does it convey category or usage information?), likable (aesthetic appeal), transferable (works across categories and geographies), adaptable (can be updated over time), and protectable (legally defensible). The first three are equity-building criteria; the last three are equity-protecting criteria. Provides a practical scoring framework for comparing element options. Emphasises that brand names are the single most important element because they appear in virtually all brand communications.

## 3. Ward.pdf
**File:** docs/newskills/08_Distinctive_Brand_Assets/Ward.pdf

Research on brand assets, brand memory, and the conditions under which brand elements transfer meaning and build recognition. Likely addresses the cognitive and learning mechanisms underlying how consumers form associations between sensory cues and brand identities. May include research on how children and new consumers develop brand asset recognition — relevant to understanding how fame builds over time in new market entrants. Provides empirical evidence for the learning and memory principles that underpin the DBA framework.
