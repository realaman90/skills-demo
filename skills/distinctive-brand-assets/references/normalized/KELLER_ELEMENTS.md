## What Are Brand Elements?

Brand elements are those trademarkable devices that serve to identify and differentiate the brand. They are the "vocabulary" of brand identity — the mix of verbal and visual markers a brand uses to present itself consistently.

**Types of brand elements:**
- Brand name
- URLs and handles
- Logos and symbols
- Characters (brand mascots)
- Slogans and taglines
- Jingles
- Packaging

## The Six Criteria for Brand Element Choice

Keller identifies six criteria for evaluating the quality of a brand element. The first three are "offensive" (building equity); the last three are "defensive" (protecting equity).

### Offensive Criteria (Building Equity)

**1. Memorable**
- How easily is the element recalled or recognised in a purchase or consumption situation?
- Is it distinctive enough to be noticed and remembered?
- High memorability reduces the cognitive effort required to retrieve the brand

**2. Meaningful**
- Does the element convey something about the product category, usage, or user?
- Meaningful elements can speed up initial adoption (consumers understand what the brand does)
- However: meaningful ≠ required; distinctiveness can outweigh meaningfulness over time

**3. Likable**
- Is the element aesthetically pleasing, fun, or interesting?
- Likable elements generate positive affect that transfers to the brand
- Particularly important for characters and visual elements

### Defensive Criteria (Protecting Equity)

**4. Transferable**
- Can the element be used to introduce new products in new categories or new markets?
- Does the element work across cultures and languages?
- Poor transferability (e.g., a name with negative connotations in another language) limits growth

**5. Adaptable**
- Can the element be updated over time without losing its recognition?
- Elements that are too rigidly designed become obsolete; flexible elements can be refreshed
- Example: Logos that can adapt to digital contexts (responsive logos, scalable marks)

**6. Protectable**
- Can the element be legally protected (trademark, copyright)?
- Is it distinctive enough that competitors cannot use similar elements without infringement?
- Protectability is the legal layer of distinctiveness

## Evaluating Brand Elements: Scoring Table

| Element | Memorable | Meaningful | Likable | Transferable | Adaptable | Protectable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Brand name | | | | | | |
| Logo / symbol | | | | | | |
| Tagline | | | | | | |
| Character | | | | | | |
| Sonic / jingle | | | | | | |
| Packaging | | | | | | |

Score 1–5 per criterion. Total by element to prioritise investment.

## Brand Name Considerations

The brand name is the most important brand element because:
- It is the most frequently used brand cue
- It appears in all communications
- It is often the only element present at point of sale

**Characteristics of strong brand names:**
- Simple and easy to pronounce
- Familiar and meaningful (or learnable to become meaningful)
- Distinctive (not generic or common)
- Legally protectable
- Translatable or at minimum, non-offensive across key markets

**Naming approaches:**
- Descriptive: names that describe the product (Simple, General Motors)
- Suggestive: names that imply an attribute (Pampers, Lean Cuisine)
- Arbitrary: real words with no obvious connection (Apple, Virgin)
- Coined/fanciful: invented words (Kodak, Xerox, Google)

Arbitrary and coined names often have the highest distinctiveness potential once learned.

## Slogan / Tagline Principles

- Slogans are verbal brand assets that capture the brand's positioning or personality
- The best slogans are both memorable (catchy) and meaningful (communicate something real)
- Slogans become brand assets when they are used consistently over long periods
- Changing slogans too often prevents them from building into genuine DBAs
- Examples: "Just Do It" (Nike), "Think Different" (Apple), "Because You're Worth It" (L'Oréal)

---

## The Complementarity Principle

Brand elements work best in combination:
- A logo + colour + name appearing together reinforce all three as linked cues
- Over time, any single element can trigger recall of the full brand identity
- The more elements that are consistently co-deployed, the more retrieval pathways exist

This is why brand guidelines exist — they ensure elements always appear together in consistent combinations.
