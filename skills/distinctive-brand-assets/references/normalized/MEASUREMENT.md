## The Two Core Metrics

Every DBA measurement programme measures two things:

**1. Fame**
The proportion of category buyers (or target audience) who correctly link the asset to the brand.
- Measured as a percentage: 0%–100%
- Higher = more people recognise this asset as belonging to your brand
- Fame is built through consistent, repeated deployment in media

**2. Uniqueness**
The degree to which the asset is exclusively linked to your brand vs. being shared with competitors.
- Often measured as: % linking to YOUR brand ÷ total % linking to ANY brand in category
- A uniqueness score of 80% means 80% of those who recognise the asset link it primarily to you
- Alternatively reported as the gap between your brand's attribution and the next-closest competitor

## Survey Methodology: Asset Attribution Test

### Method 1: Prompted Attribution
1. Show (or play) the asset — without the brand name present
2. Ask: "Which brand do you most associate this with?"
3. Calculate: % choosing your brand = Fame score
4. Calculate: % choosing your brand ÷ % choosing any brand = Uniqueness score

### Method 2: Brand-Prompted Association
1. Show the brand name
2. Ask: "Which of the following elements do you associate with this brand?" (checklist)
3. Also repeat for all major competitors
4. Fame = % of respondents associating asset with your brand
5. Uniqueness = your brand's % vs. competitor average %

### Method 3: Online Implicit Association
- Reaction-time based tests (faster response = stronger memory link)
- More rigorous but more expensive
- Useful for tracking strength of associations, not just presence

## The Distinctive Assets Grid in Practice

### Step 1: Inventory all assets
List every visual, verbal, sonic, and character element associated with your brand.
Typical list: 8–15 elements per brand.

### Step 2: Survey target audience
- Minimum sample: 300–500 category buyers per market
- For each asset: measure fame and uniqueness
- Include all major competitors' assets to identify shared/generic elements

### Step 3: Map on the DAG
Plot each asset with:
- X-axis: Fame (0%–100%)
- Y-axis: Uniqueness (0%–100%)
- Bubble size: optional — media investment, years in use, or strategic importance

### Step 4: Set investment decisions per quadrant
- Defend: Maintain and maximise deployment
- Invest: Consistent use, patience, track progress annually
- Avoid: Stop or reduce investment; do not build campaigns around these
- Ignore/Test: Evaluate potential; retire if not viable

## Benchmarks and Thresholds

Note: thresholds vary by category and asset type. Common benchmarks:

| Quadrant | Fame Threshold | Uniqueness Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Defend | >50% | >70% |
| Invest | <50% | >70% |
| Avoid | >50% | <50% |
| Ignore | <50% | <50% |

These are indicative. Brands with few strong competitors may set lower thresholds for "Defend."

## Tracking Over Time

- Re-measure annually at minimum
- Quarterly for brands in rapid-change environments
- Track "Invest" assets — are they building fame over time?
- Watch for competitive encroachment on "Defend" assets

**Key tracking questions:**
1. Are our Defend assets maintaining their fame and uniqueness?
2. Are our Invest assets building fame year-on-year?
3. Are any previously-unique assets becoming generic (Avoid zone)?
4. Are competitors building fame for assets that overlap with ours?

## Practical Caveats

- **Recency bias**: Survey responses can be influenced by recent advertising; separate "enduring recognition" from "just saw an ad"
- **Market variation**: DBA strength often varies by geography — an asset famous in home market may be unknown in new markets
- **Category buyers vs. all consumers**: Measure within the relevant category, not general population
- **Asset evolution**: Refreshed assets need to be re-measured to confirm the link is maintained
