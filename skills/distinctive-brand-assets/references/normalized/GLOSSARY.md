# Distinctive Brand Assets — Glossary

**Distinctive Brand Asset (DBA)**
Any sensory or verbal cue — visual, verbal, sonic, or character-based — that reliably triggers retrieval of a specific brand from consumer memory. Must be both famous (widely recognised) and unique (exclusively linked to the brand, not competitors).

**Distinctiveness**
The property of being uniquely associated with one brand in memory. Distinctiveness is about recognition and retrieval — does the cue point to your brand and only your brand? Distinct from differentiation.

**Differentiation**
The degree to which a brand is meaningfully different from competitors on valued attributes. Differentiation is about positioning and persuasion; distinctiveness is about identification and retrieval.

**Fame**
The proportion of the target audience who correctly link an asset to the brand. Measured as a percentage. The primary output of consistent, repeated asset deployment.

**Uniqueness**
The degree to which an asset is exclusively associated with your brand vs. shared across multiple brands. High uniqueness = the asset is a strong ownership signal.

**Distinctive Assets Grid (DAG)**
A 2×2 matrix plotting brand assets on Fame (x-axis) × Uniqueness (y-axis). Four quadrants: Defend (high/high), Invest (low/high), Avoid (high/low), Ignore/Test (low/low).

**Defend Quadrant**
DAG zone for assets with high fame and high uniqueness. These are core DBAs — protect them and maximise deployment.

**Invest Quadrant**
DAG zone for assets with low fame but high uniqueness. The asset is uniquely yours but not yet widely known. Build fame through consistent, sustained deployment.

**Avoid Quadrant**
DAG zone for assets with high fame but low uniqueness. The asset is widely known but shared with competitors — a category-generic cue. Do not invest further.

**Ignore/Test Quadrant**
DAG zone for assets with both low fame and low uniqueness. Not working on either dimension. Evaluate potential or retire.

**Brand Elements (Keller)**
Trademarkable devices used to identify and differentiate a brand: name, logo, symbol, character, slogan, jingle, packaging. Evaluated on six criteria: memorable, meaningful, likable, transferable, adaptable, protectable.

**Sonic Logo**
A short musical or audio signature (1–5 seconds) uniquely associated with a brand. Works in advertising, apps, and voice interfaces. Examples: Intel's five notes, Netflix "ta-dum."

**Brand Character / Mascot**
A visual or animated figure exclusively associated with a brand. Highly protectable (trademark). Examples: Michelin Man, Geico Gecko, Tony the Tiger.

**Category-Generic Asset**
An element (colour, symbol, concept) used by many brands in a category, providing no distinctive benefit. Example: blue for financial services, green for environmental brands.

**Mental Availability**
The propensity for a brand to be noticed or thought of in buying situations (Romaniuk & Sharp). DBAs are the memory cues that drive mental availability — they are the retrieval handles.

**Cue-to-Brand Retrieval**
The memory process by which a sensory cue activates a brand node in memory. Strong DBAs create fast, reliable retrieval; weak DBAs create slow or failed retrieval.

**Asset Evolution**
The process of updating a DBA's visual, sonic, or verbal expression while preserving the distinctive core that buyers already recognise. Evolution ≠ replacement.

**DBA Usage Guidelines**
Brand rules specifying how DBAs must be deployed in all communications — mandatory elements, minimum sizes, placement, colour codes — to protect consistency.

**Fame Score**
% of category buyers who correctly attribute an asset to the brand when the asset is presented without the brand name.

**Uniqueness Score**
Ratio of attribution to your brand vs. total attribution to any brand in the category; or the percentage-point gap between your brand and the nearest competitor.
