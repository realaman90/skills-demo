# ASSIGNMENT GUIDE: Distinctive Brand Assets

## Your role vs. the AI's role

**You** inventory and evaluate the assets. **The skill** gives you the grid and criteria.

The Distinctive Assets Grid requires real consumer data — fame and uniqueness scores — that only exists if someone has surveyed category buyers about brand recognition. If you don't have that data, you must make evidence-based estimates or conduct a simplified version of the test. The AI cannot do this for you.

## What this skill covers

- Romaniuk's Distinctive Brand Assets framework: fame × uniqueness
- The Distinctive Assets Grid (DAG): Defend / Invest / Avoid / Ignore quadrants
- Keller's six brand element criteria: memorable, meaningful, likable, transferable, adaptable, protectable
- Asset types: visual (colour, logo, shape), verbal (name, tagline, jingle), sonic, character
- Consistency: why and how to protect DBAs from creative erosion

## Before you open the skill

Do this yourself first:

1. List every brand asset you can identify for your chosen brand: logo, colour(s), typeface, tagline, character, sonic, packaging shape, jingle. Aim for 8–12 elements.
2. For each asset, make an honest estimate: what % of your target audience would correctly link this asset to the brand (Fame)?
3. For each asset, ask: would consumers associate this with any other brand in the category, or is it exclusively yours (Uniqueness)?
4. Map each asset into one of the four DAG quadrants based on your estimates.
5. Identify the one asset most at risk of being changed by an agency creative brief — and what the cost of that change would be.

## Suggested workflow

1. Complete your asset inventory and DAG mapping independently
2. Use the skill in **learn mode**: share your DAG and ask it to challenge your fame/uniqueness estimates and quadrant assignments
3. Use **audit mode** to run the full DAG analysis
4. Use **measure mode** to design a proper fame and uniqueness measurement survey
5. Use **protect mode** to build the consistency and usage guidelines argument
6. Write your assignment — cite Romaniuk and Keller as primary sources

## What the skill will probe you on (learn mode)

- Are your fame estimates based on evidence or assumption? What would prove or disprove them?
- You say the colour is distinctive — but is it actually owned by your brand or is it generic to the category (financial services blue, healthcare green)?
- Which assets are in the Invest quadrant — and what specific media and creative actions would build their fame?
- Which Defend assets are at risk from upcoming brand refreshes or agency campaigns?
- Have you considered sonic assets? Most brands underinvest in sonic distinctiveness.

## What your examiner will ask

- "Map at least 8 assets on the Distinctive Assets Grid. Justify each placement."
- "Which assets are in Defend — and what evidence supports that classification?"
- "Pick one Invest asset. Design the media and creative strategy to build its fame over 18 months."
- "Apply Keller's six criteria to a new asset the brand is considering. Should it proceed?"
- "Distinctiveness is not the same as differentiation. Explain the difference using this brand as an example."

## Academic integrity note

A DAG mapping based on gut feeling is not analysis — it is guessing with a framework imposed on top. You must either find consumer research data (brand tracking studies, recognition surveys) or design and justify your estimation methodology. Your examiner will ask how you arrived at your fame and uniqueness scores.
