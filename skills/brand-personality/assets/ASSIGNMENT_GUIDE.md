# ASSIGNMENT GUIDE: Brand Personality

## Your role vs. the AI's role

**You** read the brand. **The skill** provides the framework to articulate and evaluate it.

The skill knows Aaker's five dimensions, Kapferer's prism, the corporate character scale, and how celebrity endorsement works as meaning transfer. What it cannot know is how your chosen brand actually presents itself across touchpoints, how consumers actually describe it, or whether the personality is consistently delivered or aspirational fiction.

## What this skill covers

- Aaker's Brand Personality Scale (Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, Ruggedness)
- Kapferer's Brand Identity Prism (Physique, Personality, Culture, Relationship, Reflection, Self-image)
- Corporate character and how it differs from product brand personality
- Celebrity endorsement as cultural meaning transfer (McCracken)
- Measuring and expressing brand personality consistently

## Before you open the skill

Do this yourself first:

1. Describe your chosen brand's personality in plain language — without using the words "innovative," "trusted," "customer-centric," or "leading." Those are clichés, not personality.
2. Look at 5 pieces of the brand's actual communication (ads, social, website, packaging). What personality comes through? Is it consistent?
3. Ask: if this brand were a public figure, who would it be? Why? Would your target customer agree?
4. Rate the brand on Aaker's five dimensions before looking at the framework — 1 (low) to 5 (high) on each.
5. Is there a gap between the personality the brand intends to project and what actually comes through in executions?

## Suggested workflow

1. Complete your own personality assessment — 5 Aaker dimensions rated and justified
2. Use the skill in **learn mode**: share your assessment and ask it to challenge your ratings and reasoning
3. Use **audit mode** to run the full Aaker and Kapferer prism analysis
4. Use **express mode** if you're building or recommending personality expression guidelines
5. Write your assignment citing Aaker (1997), Kapferer, and McCracken — not the AI's output

## What the skill will probe you on (learn mode)

- Is the personality you described based on evidence from communications, or is it what you hope the brand is?
- Are there inconsistencies across touchpoints? Which touchpoint is breaking the personality?
- Does the personality differentiate the brand within its category, or is it generic to the category?
- If a celebrity endorser is used — what cultural meaning are they transferring? Is it the right meaning?
- Where is the gap between the brand's intended personality and how customers actually describe it?

---

## What your examiner will ask

- "Rate this brand on Aaker's five dimensions and justify each rating with specific evidence from brand communications."
- "Apply Kapferer's prism to this brand. Which facets are strong and which are underdeveloped?"
- "Is the brand personality consistent across all touchpoints? Where does it break down?"
- "If the brand is using a celebrity endorser — apply McCracken's meaning transfer model. Is the endorsement strategically sound?"
- "How would you measure whether a brand personality change campaign has worked?"

## Academic integrity note

Aaker's five-dimension ratings must be grounded in specific, observable evidence from brand communications — not from general impressions. A submission that rates a brand "4 out of 5 on Sincerity because they seem genuine" without citing specific executional evidence will not meet academic standards. Show your evidence.
