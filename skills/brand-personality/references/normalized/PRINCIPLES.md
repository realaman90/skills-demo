### What Is Brand Personality?
- Brand personality is the set of human characteristics associated with a brand.
- Consumers attribute personality traits to brands in the same way they attribute traits to people — based on direct experience, advertising, spokesperson associations, packaging, and category cues.
- Brand personality creates a human dimension for an otherwise abstract entity (company, product, service).

### Why Brand Personality Matters
- **Differentiation**: Personality traits can differentiate brands when functional attributes are similar.
- **Emotional connection**: Personality creates a relational bridge — consumers form bonds with brands they "like" as they would with people.
- **Self-expression**: Consumers choose brands whose personalities align with their own self-concept (actual or desired).
- **Trust and loyalty**: A consistent, authentic personality builds trust over time.
- **Communication efficiency**: A defined personality guides voice, tone, and creative decisions across all touchpoints.

### Brand Personality vs. Brand Identity vs. Brand Image
- **Brand personality**: The human traits associated with the brand — one dimension of brand identity.
- **Brand identity**: The full set of brand associations the company intends to create — includes personality, physique, culture, relationship, reflection, self-image (Kapferer).
- **Brand image**: How the brand is actually perceived by consumers — may differ from intended identity.
- Brand personality is an input (intentional design) that shapes brand image (perceived output).

### How Brand Personality Is Formed
Consumers attribute personality to brands through:
1. **Direct associations**: Spokesperson, celebrity endorser, typical user imagery.
2. **Indirect associations**: Product attributes, price, distribution channel, advertising style.
3. **Category cues**: The category itself carries personality cues (e.g., luxury goods = Sophistication; outdoor equipment = Ruggedness).
4. **Behavioural cues**: How the brand behaves — customer service, social media voice, crisis response.
5. **Visual cues**: Logo style, colours, typography, packaging shape and texture.

### Self-Concept Congruence
- Consumers prefer brands whose personality matches their own self-concept — how they see themselves or how they want to be seen.
- **Actual self-congruence**: Brand personality matches how consumers actually see themselves.
- **Ideal self-congruence**: Brand personality matches how consumers want to be seen (aspirational brands).
- Ideal self-congruence is a stronger driver for aspirational/luxury categories.

### Authenticity in Brand Personality
- Brand personality must be authentic — grounded in the brand's genuine culture, history, and capabilities.
- Inauthentic personality claims are quickly detected by consumers and damage trust.
- Personality should emerge from what the brand genuinely is, then be amplified — not invented wholesale.
