### Overview
Jean-Noël Kapferer's Brand Identity Prism is a six-facet model for defining a brand's full identity — of which personality is one dimension. It is broader and richer than personality alone.

The prism has two axes:
- **Sender ↔ Receiver**: Left side = brand sends; Right side = as reflected/received by consumer.
- **Externalised ↔ Internalised**: Top = outward expression; Bottom = inner values and meaning.

### The Six Facets

**1. Physique** (Externalised / Sender)
- The brand's physical characteristics — its tangible, objective features.
- The flagship product, key attributes, visual identity.
- The physical backbone of the brand.
- Example (Apple): Sleek design, premium materials, minimalist aesthetic.
- Example (Coca-Cola): The red can, the contour bottle, the fizz.

**2. Personality** (Externalised / Sender)
- The human character traits the brand would have if it were a person.
- Expressed through voice, tone, communication style, and spokesperson.
- Directly maps to Aaker's five dimensions.
- Example (Apple): Imaginative, innovative, cool, slightly rebellious (Excitement + Sophistication).

**3. Culture** (Externalised / Sender)
- The system of values and principles from which the brand draws its behaviour.
- Often rooted in the brand's country of origin or founding philosophy.
- Differentiates brands that share similar personality and physique.
- Example (Nike): American meritocracy — "Just Do It", the culture of athletic achievement.
- Example (Mercedes): German engineering rigour and precision.

**4. Relationship** (Externalised / Receiver)
- The relationship the brand establishes with its customers.
- What kind of relationship does the brand embody — mentor, friend, partner, expert advisor, entertainer?
- Example (Amazon): Reliable, efficient service partner — "We'll handle it."
- Example (Virgin): Irreverent challenger fighting on behalf of the consumer.

**5. Reflection** (Internalised / Receiver)
- The type of customer the brand appears to be *for* — the reflected customer image.
- Not who the customer actually is — but who the brand shows in its communications.
- Reflection is aspirational: it shows the customer the brand wants to be associated with.
- Example (Chanel): The independent, elegant, sophisticated woman.
- Example (Red Bull): The high-performance athlete or extreme sports enthusiast.

**6. Self-Image** (Internalised / Receiver)
- How the customer sees themselves when using the brand — the internal mirror.
- The inner relationship: "When I use this brand, I am [X]."
- Example (Patagonia buyer's self-image): "I am someone who cares about the planet and lives adventurously."
- Example (BMW buyer's self-image): "I am someone who values performance and success."

### How to Use the Prism

**To define brand identity**: Fill in all six facets explicitly. Resolve any tensions between facets.

**To diagnose inconsistency**: Check whether all six facets are aligned and reinforce each other. Misaligned facets create confused brand identity.

**To differentiate**: Two brands may share physique and personality — culture or relationship differentiates them.

**To guide communication**: Each communication channel can emphasise different facets:
- Advertising → Personality, Reflection
- PR → Culture, Relationship
- Packaging → Physique, Personality
- Customer experience → Relationship, Self-Image
