### Applying the Aaker Framework

**Step 1 — Audit current perception**: Survey consumers on which traits they associate with the brand (use trait lists from the scale). Map to the five dimensions.

**Step 2 — Identify intended personality**: Which two or three dimensions best represent the brand's desired position? Choose primary and secondary dimensions.

**Step 3 — Gap analysis**: Where does perceived personality differ from intended? What traits are incorrectly attributed? What desired traits are missing?

**Step 4 — Competitive mapping**: Map competitors on the same five dimensions. Where is the brand differentiated? Where is it undifferentiated?

**Step 5 — Consistency audit**: Are all brand touchpoints (advertising, packaging, customer service, social media) consistently expressing the intended personality dimensions?

### Important Caveats
- The scale was developed in the US context (1997) — cross-cultural applications should validate dimension structure locally.
- Some dimensions (especially Ruggedness and Sophistication) show cultural variation.
- The scale measures perception — it does not guarantee that personality drives purchase. Link personality to business outcomes.
