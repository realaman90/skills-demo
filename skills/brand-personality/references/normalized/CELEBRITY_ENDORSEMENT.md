### McCracken's Meaning Transfer Model
Grant McCracken (1989) proposed that celebrities are effective brand endorsers not because of their fame alone — but because of the cultural meaning they carry.

**The Three-Stage Transfer Process:**
1. **Cultural world → Celebrity**: Celebrities accumulate meaning from the roles they play, the causes they champion, the lifestyle they embody, and the cultural moment they represent.
2. **Celebrity → Brand**: When a celebrity endorses a brand, that cultural meaning transfers to the brand.
3. **Brand → Consumer**: Consumers adopt the meaning embedded in the brand through purchase and use.

The model explains why the wrong celebrity can be damaging — their meanings transfer too, including negative ones.

### What Makes a Good Celebrity-Brand Fit?
Fit should be evaluated on three levels:

**1. Personality/Trait Fit**
- Do the celebrity's personality traits match the brand's intended personality dimensions (Aaker scale)?
- A Sincerity brand needs a sincere, relatable celebrity — not a flashy, edgy one.
- A Ruggedness brand needs a celebrity associated with outdoor toughness — not urban glamour.

**2. Meaning Fit**
- What cultural meanings does the celebrity carry?
- Are those meanings consistent with the brand's identity, values, and positioning?
- Do the celebrity's associations reinforce the Category Entry Points the brand is trying to own?

**3. Audience Fit**
- Does the celebrity's fanbase/audience overlap with the brand's target buyer?
- Is the celebrity credible to the brand's category? (A tech CEO may not be credible as a sportswear endorser.)

### Risks of Celebrity Endorsement
- **Meaning contamination**: If the celebrity's image changes negatively (scandal, controversy), the transferred meaning damages the brand.
- **Overshadowing**: An extremely famous celebrity may overshadow the brand — consumers remember the celebrity, not the brand.
- **Conflicting associations**: Celebrity with multiple brand endorsements may carry diluted or conflicting meanings.
- **Cultural mismatch**: Celebrity meaning that works in one culture may not transfer in others.

### When Celebrity Endorsement Builds Brand Personality
- Most effective when the brand is new or lacks a defined personality — the celebrity provides instant personality shorthand.
- Effective when the brand needs to communicate an aspirational or lifestyle personality quickly.
- Effective when the category is low-involvement — a recognisable face provides a cue for trust and salience.

### Alternatives to Celebrity Endorsement
- **Brand character / mascot**: A fictional character with designed personality traits (no risk of scandal).
- **Archetype casting**: Recurring non-celebrity characters embodying the brand personality.
- **Founder-as-personality**: The founder's personality becomes the brand's personality (Elon Musk/Tesla, Steve Jobs/Apple).
- **Employee voices**: Real employees as brand embodiments — effective for Sincerity and Integrity dimensions.

### Selecting a Celebrity Endorser — Decision Framework
1. Define the brand's intended personality dimensions (Aaker).
2. Map celebrity candidates against those dimensions — who aligns best?
3. Audit the celebrity's full meaning portfolio: What cultural roles have they played? What causes do they represent? What scandals have they faced?
4. Assess meaning portability: Does the celebrity's meaning translate to the brand's categories and markets?
5. Evaluate audience overlap: Does the celebrity's audience match the brand's target buyers?
6. Assess longevity: Is the celebrity's relevance likely to last for the duration of the endorsement?
