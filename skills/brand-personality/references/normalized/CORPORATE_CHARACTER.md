### Why Corporate Brand Personality Differs from Product Brand Personality
- Corporate brands are evaluated by multiple stakeholder groups: customers, employees, investors, partners, regulators, media.
- Corporate personality must resonate across all stakeholder groups — not just consumers.
- The dimensions that matter differ: employees care about Agreeableness and Integrity; investors care about Competence and Drive; customers care about Warmth and Trustworthiness.

### Davies et al. — The Corporate Character Scale
Davies, Chun, da Silva and Roper developed the Corporate Character Scale, adapted from Aaker's framework for corporate contexts.

**Seven dimensions of corporate character:**

1. **Agreeableness**: Warm, agreeable, friendly, open, straightforward.
   - Relevant to: customer-facing brands, service organisations, consumer businesses.

2. **Enterprise**: Cool, innovative, extrovert, trendy.
   - Relevant to: technology companies, startups, challenger brands.

3. **Competence**: Reliable, efficient, hardworking, conscientious.
   - Relevant to: professional services, B2B, financial institutions.

4. **Chic**: Elegant, prestigious, exclusive, refined.
   - Relevant to: luxury corporate brands, premium B2B positioning.

5. **Ruthlessness**: Arrogant, aggressive, selfish, controlling.
   - A negative dimension — high scores here damage reputation, especially with employees.
   - Large incumbents often score high here unintentionally.

6. **Mahogany** (Informality): Informal, easy-going, down-to-earth.
   - Relevant to: founder-led businesses, SMEs, brands seeking approachability.

7. **Integrity**: Responsible, honest, ethical, transparent.
   - Critical for all corporate brands — especially post-crisis, in regulated industries, or when ESG is a priority.

### Keller on Corporate Personality
- Keller emphasises that corporate brands communicate personality through the full range of corporate communications — not just advertising.
- Corporate personality is shaped by: leadership behaviour, employee interactions, press coverage, CSR activity, investor communications.
- Consistency of personality signals across all corporate touchpoints is critical.

### Corporate Personality in B2B
- In B2B, Competence and Integrity are the most critical corporate personality dimensions — buyers need to trust the capability and ethics of a supplier.
- Agreeableness matters for long-term relationships — especially in professional services.
- Enterprise / Innovation dimensions matter when the corporate brand is a technology or transformation partner.
- Ruthlessness is especially damaging in B2B — buyers will not lock into long-term relationships with suppliers perceived as self-serving.

### Employer Brand Personality
- The corporate personality perceived by employees (and candidates) may differ from customer-facing personality.
- The Corporate Character Scale can be applied separately to employee and customer audiences — gaps indicate internal/external brand misalignment.
- Key dimensions for employer brand: Agreeableness, Integrity, Competence.

### Aligning Corporate and Product Personality
- Corporate and product brand personalities should be compatible — inconsistencies confuse stakeholders.
- If the corporate brand is Competent/Trustworthy (IBM) and a product brand is Exciting/Edgy, the product may need to signal its corporate parentage selectively.
- Endorsed brand architecture (e.g., "Powered by IBM") allows product personality freedom while borrowing corporate credibility.
