# GLOSSARY

## Brand Personality Terminology

### Brand Personality
The set of human characteristics associated with a brand. Consumers attribute traits to brands as they would to people — driven by advertising, spokespersons, product attributes, and category cues. Defined and scaled by Jennifer Aaker (1997).

### Aaker's Five Dimensions
The five empirically validated dimensions of brand personality: Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness. Each contains two or more sub-facets and associated trait adjectives.

### Sincerity
Aaker personality dimension: down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, cheerful. Brands perceived as genuine, family-oriented, and warmly human. Example brands: Dove, Hallmark.

### Excitement
Aaker personality dimension: daring, spirited, imaginative, up-to-date. Brands perceived as bold, creative, youthful, and innovative. Example brands: Nike, Red Bull.

### Competence
Aaker personality dimension: reliable, intelligent, successful. Brands perceived as trustworthy, expert, and authoritative. Example brands: IBM, Volvo, American Express.

### Sophistication
Aaker personality dimension: upper class, charming. Brands perceived as glamorous, elegant, and aspirational. Example brands: Chanel, Mercedes-Benz, Rolex.

### Ruggedness
Aaker personality dimension: outdoorsy, tough. Brands perceived as masculine, physical, and durable. Example brands: Jeep, Levi's, Timberland.

### Brand Identity
The full set of brand associations the company intends to create — broader than personality alone. Kapferer's Brand Identity Prism captures six facets: Physique, Personality, Culture, Relationship, Reflection, and Self-Image.

### Brand Image
How the brand is actually perceived by consumers. May differ from intended brand identity. The gap between identity and image is a key diagnostic signal.

### Brand Identity Prism (Kapferer)
A six-facet model: Physique (tangible features), Personality (human traits), Culture (values and principles), Relationship (brand-consumer interaction type), Reflection (the portrayed customer), Self-Image (how consumers see themselves using the brand).

### Self-Concept Congruence
The degree to which a brand's personality matches a consumer's actual self-concept or ideal self-concept. Brands that match ideal self-concept are especially effective in aspirational categories.

### Actual Self-Congruence
Brand personality aligns with how a consumer sees themselves as they actually are.

### Ideal Self-Congruence
Brand personality aligns with how a consumer wants to be seen — aspirational alignment. More powerful in luxury and lifestyle categories.

### Corporate Character Scale
A seven-dimension scale adapted from Aaker for corporate brand contexts: Agreeableness, Enterprise, Competence, Chic, Ruthlessness, Mahogany (Informality), and Integrity. Developed by Davies, Chun, da Silva and Roper.

### Meaning Transfer (McCracken)
The process by which cultural meanings embedded in a celebrity transfer to the brand they endorse, then from the brand to consumers. Underpins celebrity endorsement strategy.

### Cultural Meaning
The symbolic significance a celebrity carries from their cultural roles, public persona, causes, and associations. The raw material of meaning transfer.

### Personality Brief
An internal brand document that defines: the intended personality dimensions, what they mean in practice, what they explicitly do NOT mean, and how they manifest in voice, tone, visuals, and behaviour.

### Brand Voice
The consistent expression of brand personality through written and verbal communication — the "who" behind the words. Personality-driven.

### Brand Tone
The contextual variation of brand voice across different situations (empathetic in customer service, confident in advertising, humble in an apology). Voice is constant; tone shifts.
