## How to Build and Express Brand Personality

---

### 1. Define the Personality Before Expressing It
- Choose a primary dimension (dominant personality) and one or two secondary dimensions.
- Avoid claiming all five Aaker dimensions — no brand is simultaneously Sincere, Exciting, Competent, Sophisticated, AND Rugged. That is no personality at all.
- Write a "personality brief": 3–5 traits, what they mean in practice, and what they explicitly do NOT mean.
- Example: "Competent — means: measured, evidence-led, authoritative. Does NOT mean: cold, robotic, humourless."

### 2. Translate Personality into Voice and Tone
Every personality dimension implies specific voice and tone choices:

| Dimension | Voice tends to be… | Tone in ads | Words to use | Words to avoid |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sincerity | Warm, plain-spoken | Heartfelt, human | "We believe", "real", "together" | Corporate jargon, superlatives |
| Excitement | Energetic, playful | Bold, urgent, fun | "Now", "unleash", "dare" | Cautious, hedging language |
| Competence | Precise, confident | Authoritative | Facts, data, "proven", "trusted" | Vague claims, emotional excess |
| Sophistication | Refined, understated | Elegant | Quality descriptors, heritage terms | Slang, mass-market language |
| Ruggedness | Direct, no-nonsense | Grounded, strong | Active verbs, physicality | Softening qualifiers |

### 3. Express Personality Through Visual Identity
- **Sincerity**: Natural colours, photography of real people and moments, rounded fonts, informal layouts.
- **Excitement**: Bold/primary colours, dynamic layouts, hand-drawn or custom type, high-energy imagery.
- **Competence**: Clean grids, sans-serif fonts, data visualisations, confident negative space, navy/grey/white palettes.
- **Sophistication**: Monochromatic or muted palettes, serif typography, premium photography, generous white space.
- **Ruggedness**: Earthy tones, textured materials, bold sans-serif type, outdoor photography, weathered aesthetics.

### 4. Cast Spokespeople and Brand Characters Consistently
- Ensure all brand representatives (celebrity endorsers, actors in ads, customer service staff tone) embody the personality dimensions.
- Apply McCracken's meaning transfer check: Does this person carry meanings that reinforce our personality?
- Avoid casting choices that introduce personality contradictions (a Ruggedness brand using a glamorous celebrity).

### 5. Apply Personality to Customer Experience
- Personality must go beyond advertising — it should inform every customer interaction.
- Customer service scripts: Does the language feel Sincere? Competent? Sophisticated?
- Error messages, email confirmations, onboarding flows — all express personality or undermine it.
- Store/office design should physically embody personality: minimalist for Competence, warm and tactile for Sincerity, dramatic for Sophistication.

### 6. Enforce Personality Consistency Across Teams
- Personality guidelines should be part of the brand guidelines shared across marketing, product, comms, and customer success.
- Run personality audits (see MEASUREMENT.md) periodically across all touchpoints.
- When launching new campaigns or products, run a personality fit check: Does this reinforce or contradict our dimensions?

### 7. Evolve Personality — Deliberately and Slowly
- Personality can evolve over time — but sudden shifts destroy trust and confuse brand memory.
- If a brand needs to shift personality (e.g., from Competence to Excitement as it enters a new market), do so gradually through adjacent traits.
- Document the evolution rationale — "we are moving from purely Competent toward Competent + Imaginative" — and communicate it internally.
