# MEASUREMENT

## Measuring Brand Personality

---

### Method 1: Aaker Brand Personality Scale Survey
The standard measurement approach using Jennifer Aaker's validated trait battery.

**Survey design:**
- Present respondents with a list of 42 personality trait adjectives (covering all five dimensions).
- Ask: "To what extent does [trait] describe [Brand]?" on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely well).
- Run for the focal brand AND key competitors in the same survey.

**Analysis:**
- Average scores per dimension (group traits by dimension).
- Create a five-dimension personality profile for the brand.
- Compare profiles across competitors — identify personality differentiation or overlap.
- Gap analysis: Compare intended personality (from brand team) vs. perceived personality (from consumers).

**Sample trait battery (selected):**

| Sincerity | Excitement | Competence | Sophistication | Ruggedness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Down-to-earth | Daring | Reliable | Upper class | Outdoorsy |
| Honest | Spirited | Intelligent | Charming | Tough |
| Wholesome | Imaginative | Successful | Good-looking | Rugged |
| Cheerful | Up-to-date | Hard-working | Glamorous | Western |

### Method 2: Qualitative Projective Techniques
For exploratory understanding of brand personality — especially when consumers can't articulate traits directly.

- **Personification**: "If this brand were a person, who would it be? Describe them."
- **Obituary exercise**: "If this brand died, what would its obituary say?"
- **Brand as guest at a party**: "If this brand came to a dinner party, how would they behave? What would they wear? What would they talk about?"
- **Magazine exercise**: "If this brand published a magazine, what would it cover? Show me an image from its pages."

These exercises surface rich, nuanced personality perceptions that trait rating scales miss.

### Method 3: Brand Personality Consistency Audit
An internal audit of how consistently the brand's personality is expressed across touchpoints.

**Audit dimensions:**
- **Voice and tone**: Is written/verbal communication consistent in tone? (Apply Aaker dimensions to copy samples.)
- **Visual identity**: Do design choices (colour, typography, imagery) reinforce or contradict personality dimensions?
- **Spokesperson/talent**: Do on-camera talent and spokespeople embody the intended personality?
- **Customer service interactions**: Do service conversations feel consistent with the personality?
- **Social media**: Does the brand's social persona match the intended personality?
- **Packaging / environment**: Do physical touchpoints express the right traits?

**Rating scale for consistency audit:**
- Strongly reinforces personality → Neutral → Contradicts personality (1–5 per touchpoint)
- Sum scores to find the strongest and weakest consistency gaps.

### Method 4: Tracking Over Time
- Run Aaker scale surveys quarterly or biannually to track personality perception shifts.
- Monitor competitive personality maps — are competitors moving into your personality space?
- Correlate personality dimension scores with brand health metrics (purchase intent, NPS, consideration).

### Key Diagnostic Questions
- Which personality dimensions are we strongly perceived on? Which are absent?
- Where do we overlap with competitors — are we truly differentiated in personality?
- Which dimensions are we intending to own but failing to communicate?
- Is our personality consistent across all touchpoints — or fragmented by channel or team?
- Does our personality match what our target audience values and identifies with?
