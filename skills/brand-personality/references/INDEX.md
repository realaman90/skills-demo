## Gaps
- Direct verbatim text extraction from PDFs is limited. Enable OCR (ENABLE_OCR=1) for better extraction.
- Aaker's original trait battery has 42 items; condensed version provided here — refer to source PDF for the full validated scale.
- Cross-cultural validation of Aaker's scale (non-US markets) is available in academic literature — use web_search for specific market data.
