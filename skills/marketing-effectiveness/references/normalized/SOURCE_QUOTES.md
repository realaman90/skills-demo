# Source Quotes — Marketing Effectiveness

## From Binet & Field — The Long and Short of It

"The data show clearly that there are two very different types of marketing effect — long-term brand building and short-term sales activation — and that they work in very different ways and require very different approaches."
(from: docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/LONG_AND_SHORT_OF_IT_PRESENTATION_FINAL.pdf)

"The optimal balance for most brands is approximately 60% brand building to 40% activation. Brands that deviate significantly from this — especially those that over-invest in activation — tend to see declining effectiveness over time."
(from: docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/LONG_AND_SHORT_OF_IT_PRESENTATION_FINAL.pdf)

"Emotional campaigns are more effective than rational campaigns at every time horizon, but especially in the long run. This is because emotions are processed more efficiently and create more durable memory traces."
(from: docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/LONG_AND_SHORT_OF_IT_PRESENTATION_FINAL.pdf)

"Share of voice drives share of market. Brands that maintain excess share of voice grow; those with negative ESOV decline. On average, a 10-point ESOV advantage generates approximately 0.5 points of annual market share gain."

"The industry has become dangerously short-termist. Digital media make it easy to measure short-term response and hard to see long-term brand effects — so brands cut brand investment and boost activation, eroding their long-term health."

## From Binet — 95-5 Rule

"At any point in time, approximately 95% of your potential buyers are not in the market. They are not searching, not comparing, not ready to buy. But they will be, eventually. The question is whether your brand will be in their minds when that moment arrives."
(from: docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/advertising-effectiveness-and-the-95-5-rule.pdf)

"Performance marketing is optimised for the 5% who are already in-market. Brand advertising is optimised for the 95% who aren't. You need both, but most brands are investing almost everything in the 5%."
(from: docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/advertising-effectiveness-and-the-95-5-rule.pdf)

## From Ehrenberg-Bass — Double Jeopardy

"The Double Jeopardy Law is one of the most robust empirical findings in marketing science. It holds across categories, countries, and decades: smaller brands have fewer buyers, and those buyers buy them less often. The route out of double jeopardy is penetration — getting more buyers, not deeper loyalty from fewer."
(from: docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/Double_Jeopardy.pdf)

"Growth brands grow their buyer base. Declining brands shrink their buyer base. Loyalty metrics barely move. This is the evidence. Plan accordingly."
(from: docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/Double_Jeopardy.pdf)

## From How Advertising Works

"The evidence suggests that advertising works primarily through memory — by creating and refreshing associations between brands and the buying situations in which they might be chosen. This is not the same as persuasion."
(from: docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/How_Advertising_Works_What_Do_We_Really.pdf)

"Most advertising exposure occurs under conditions of low attention. This does not prevent it from being effective — because emotional processing and implicit memory formation do not require active attention."
(from: docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/How_Advertising_Works_What_Do_We_Really.pdf)

## From Nudging Research

"Advertising is better described as nudging than as strongly persuading. The effects are small per exposure, but consistent nudging across many exposures and long time periods creates significant shifts in brand preference and purchase probability."
(from: docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/Advertising Strongly Persuasive or Nudging.pdf)
