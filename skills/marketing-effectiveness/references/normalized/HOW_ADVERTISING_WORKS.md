## Two Models of How Advertising Works

### The Persuasion Model (Traditional / Rational)
**Assumptions:**
- Advertising works by providing information and rational arguments
- Consumers consciously process advertising messages
- Attitude change leads to behaviour change (the hierarchy of effects: awareness → interest → desire → action)
- Strong ads are those with compelling rational arguments

**Problems with this model:**
- Most consumers process advertising with low attention
- Most purchase decisions are habit-driven or heuristic-based, not deliberative
- Emotional response to advertising often predicts effectiveness better than recall of message content
- Purely rational advertising works for high-involvement categories but is weak for most everyday purchases

### The Emotional/Memory Model (Modern Evidence-Based)
**Assumptions:**
- Advertising works primarily by building and refreshing memory structures
- Low-attention processing (passive viewing, ambient exposure) is sufficient to create associations
- Emotional responses to advertising create stronger and more durable memory encoding
- The goal is to build brand associations that are activated at the moment of purchase
- You don't need to persuade; you need to be remembered

**Evidence:**
- Andrew Ehrenberg's "weak theory" of advertising: ads nudge rather than strongly persuade
- Byron Sharp: advertising maintains and refreshes salience; it doesn't primarily shift attitudes
- Robert Heath: "low attention processing" — ads work even when people aren't paying attention
- IPA data: emotional campaigns consistently outperform rational campaigns on long-term effects

## Strong vs. Weak Theory of Advertising

**Strong Theory** (Jones, Reeves & Trout — traditional view):
- Advertising can strongly persuade people to switch brands
- The effect is primarily through rational argument and attitude change
- This model supports the idea that every ad should have a clear, compelling USP

**Weak Theory** (Ehrenberg, Sharp, Heath):
- For established brands, advertising primarily reinforces and nudges; it does not strongly convert
- Most category buyers are already familiar with most brands in the category
- Advertising maintains mental availability rather than changing minds
- This model supports always-on, broad reach, emotionally resonant advertising

**Modern consensus**: Both models apply in different contexts.
- New products launching in a category: Strong theory applies — you need to create awareness and trial
- Established brands in mature categories: Weak theory applies — maintain salience and associations

## The Role of Emotion in Advertising

Neuroscience and psychological research consistently shows:
- Emotional processing is faster than rational processing
- Emotional responses to ads create stronger implicit memories (not consciously accessible but behaviourally influential)
- Ads that create positive emotional responses are more likely to transfer those feelings to the brand
- Emotional ads work better at low attention (processing the "feeling" requires less cognitive effort than processing an argument)

**Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis**: Purchase decisions require emotional input. Purely rational information processing is insufficient for decision-making; emotional associations guide choice.

## Low Attention Processing (Heath)

Robert Heath's research challenges the assumption that advertising must be consciously processed to be effective:
- Consumers don't attend to most advertising they are exposed to
- But even passively processed advertising creates associative memory traces
- Emotional content is processed more effectively under low attention than rational content
- This is why emotional brand advertising can work even when people "skip" it mentally

**Implications:**
- Advertising doesn't need to be "noticed" or "remembered" consciously to work
- Focus on the emotional quality of executions, not just message clarity
- Measure implicit associations and emotional response, not just recall

## Advertising and Nudging

Research comparing "strongly persuasive" vs. "nudging" models of advertising (referenced in the skill source):
- Most advertising effects are closer to nudging than strong persuasion
- Small, consistent nudges across many exposures accumulate into significant brand preference
- This supports consistent, long-running brand advertising rather than one-off persuasion campaigns
- Consistency of message and creative style amplifies the nudging effect

## Practical Implications for Creative Strategy

1. **Lead with emotion** — emotional resonance creates stronger, more durable associations
2. **Keep it simple** — complex rational arguments require high attention; simple emotional stories work at low attention
3. **Be consistent** — the same emotional territory, consistently occupied, creates cumulative memory effects
4. **Build brand codes into the creative** — DBAs must appear early and prominently (first 3 seconds of video)
5. **Optimise for feeling, not just recall** — measure how the ad makes people feel, not just what they remember
