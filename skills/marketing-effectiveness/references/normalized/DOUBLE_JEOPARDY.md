## The Law

The Double Jeopardy Law states that **smaller brands suffer twice**:
1. They have **fewer buyers** (lower penetration)
2. Those buyers **buy the brand less often** (lower purchase frequency / loyalty)

This is not a coincidence or a separate problem — it is a mathematical regularity. Both lower penetration AND lower purchase frequency are predictable consequences of having a smaller market share.

## What the Data Shows

Across virtually all FMCG categories and many service categories, the relationship between market share and brand loyalty metrics follows a predictable pattern:

| Brand | Market Share | Penetration | Purchase Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Large brand | 30% | High | Higher |
| Medium brand | 15% | Medium | Medium |
| Small brand | 5% | Low | Lower |

The pattern holds remarkably consistently across categories and countries. It is a law of markets, not an anomaly.

## Why This Matters for Marketing Strategy

**The wrong conclusion**: "Our buyers are less loyal — we need to invest in loyalty programmes to increase purchase frequency."

**The right conclusion**: "Our purchase frequency is low because we have low penetration. The primary route to growth is **acquiring more buyers** (penetration), not making existing buyers more frequent."

This is because:
- As penetration grows, purchase frequency also increases — it is a consequence, not a separate lever
- Loyalty programmes rarely move the needle for small brands (the pool of loyalists is too small)
- Double Jeopardy means you can't fix loyalty without first fixing penetration

## The Penetration Imperative

Ehrenberg-Bass research consistently shows that brand growth is primarily driven by:
1. **Increasing penetration** — getting more people to buy the brand at least once
2. **Light buyers** — most of a brand's buyers are light buyers (buy once or twice a year)
3. **Reach** — the key marketing task is to reach and convert non-buyers and light buyers, not to deepen commitment of heavy buyers

Heavy users are valuable but they are a small part of the audience and are already committed. Light users and non-buyers represent the growth opportunity.

## Double Jeopardy and Advertising

Advertising implications:
- Advertising should target **all category buyers** (broad reach), not just existing customers
- Heavy users do not need advertising to maintain their behaviour; light users and non-buyers do
- Loyalty-focused advertising targeting only existing customers misses most of the growth opportunity
- Broad reach media is more effective for growth than precisely targeted CRM

**The mass marketing argument**: For most brands in most categories, the most efficient growth strategy is broad-reach mass communication that reaches all category buyers — including non-buyers and light buyers who represent the growth opportunity.

## Double Jeopardy and Brand Extensions / New Products

When a brand launches a product extension:
- The extension starts with low penetration
- It therefore suffers Double Jeopardy
- The priority must be penetration (trial) not loyalty (repeat)
- Media strategy should focus on reach and trial generation, not targeting existing brand users

## Exceptions and Nuances

Double Jeopardy holds in most markets but has some nuances:
- **Niche brands**: Brands with a highly distinctive positioning can achieve loyalty above their penetration-predicted level (but this is rare)
- **Subscription models**: Churn and retention are more complex than purchase frequency in FMCG
- **B2B**: Relationship dynamics are more complex; but penetration still drives growth
- The law describes averages — individual brands can outperform predictions with exceptional distinctiveness or category creation
