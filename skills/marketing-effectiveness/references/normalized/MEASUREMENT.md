## The Measurement Gap

Most marketing measurement systems are biased toward short-term, activation-type effects:
- Digital attribution models capture clicks and conversions within days
- Marketing mix models typically use 13-week data windows
- ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) measures immediate sales response

This creates systematic under-reporting of brand building ROI — because most of brand building's value is realised over 12–36 months.

**The result**: Finance teams see activation "working" (immediate, measurable) and brand building "not working" (no immediate signal) → budget cuts brand building → long-term effectiveness declines.

## A Two-Horizon Measurement Framework

Effectiveness must be measured on two timeframes simultaneously:

### Short-Term (0–13 weeks)
- Sales uplift vs. baseline
- Conversion rates
- ROAS / CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
- Click-through rates, engagement
- Promotional redemption rates

These measure activation effectiveness.

### Long-Term (6 months – 3 years)
- Market share trend
- Brand equity metrics (awareness, consideration, preference)
- Price premium vs. category
- Penetration growth
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) trends
- ESOV vs. SOM trend

These measure brand building effectiveness.

## Key Effectiveness Metrics by Goal

| Goal | Metric | Timeframe |
|---|---|---|
| Grow penetration | Household penetration %, trial rate | Medium (6–12 months) |
| Improve mental availability | Unaided awareness, top-of-mind recall | Medium |
| Build brand equity | Consideration, preference, NPS | Medium–Long |
| Grow market share | SOM trend | Long |
| Protect pricing | Price premium vs. category | Long |
| Improve ESOV | SOV vs. competitors | Ongoing |
| Short-term sales | Revenue uplift, ROAS | Short |
| Conversion | CTR, CVR, CPA | Short |

## Brand Tracking as a Leading Indicator

Brand tracking surveys provide leading indicators of future business performance:

**Leading indicators → Lagging outcomes:**
- Awareness → Consideration → Purchase intent → Actual purchase
- Trust → Loyalty → Lifetime value
- Preference → Price tolerance → Margin

A brand whose consideration is declining today will show revenue decline in 6–18 months. Tracking brand metrics provides early warning that pure sales tracking misses.

**Minimum brand tracking programme:**
- Quarterly (at minimum) surveys of category buyers
- Unaided brand awareness
- Brand consideration (in shortlist)
- Brand preference (first choice)
- Key association ratings (2–3 brand-relevant attributes)
- All measured vs. competitors

## Econometrics and Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM)

Marketing mix models decompose sales into contributions from different marketing activities:
- Base sales (no advertising) vs. incremental (from advertising)
- Short-term vs. long-term advertising effects
- ROI by channel and campaign type

**Binet & Field's finding on MMM**: Models built on 13-week data capture only ~40% of advertising's true effect. Full-year or multi-year models capture the long-term brand building component.

**Good MMM practice:**
- Use 2–3 years of data minimum
- Include brand equity metrics as variables (not just sales)
- Separate short-term and long-term effects
- Model the interaction between brand and activation spend

## The Effektsystemet / Kommunikation som ger effekt

The Scandinavian effectiveness measurement system (Effektsystemet) provides a structured approach for evaluating communication effects across multiple levels:

1. **Communication effects** — Did audiences receive and process the communication?
2. **Brand effects** — Did brand perceptions change?
3. **Behaviour effects** — Did purchase behaviour change?
4. **Business effects** — Did financial outcomes improve?

This cascade model is consistent with the IPA methodology and provides a structured framework for demonstrating marketing's contribution at each level of the funnel.

## Countering Short-Termism in Reporting

When reporting to leadership or finance:
1. **Present short AND long-term metrics** — never just ROAS
2. **Show brand equity trend** — leading indicator of future performance
3. **Show ESOV vs. SOM** — demonstrates strategic positioning
4. **Model what happens if brand investment is cut** — quantify the long-term cost of short-termism
5. **Reference IPA benchmarks** — 60/40, ESOV → SOM, long-term vs. short-term split
