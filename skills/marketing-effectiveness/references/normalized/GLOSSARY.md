# Marketing Effectiveness — Glossary

**Marketing Effectiveness**
The degree to which marketing investment achieves its intended business outcomes — including both short-term sales and long-term brand equity, market share, and pricing power.

**Brand Building**
Marketing activities that create and refresh memory structures and emotional associations — building mental availability and future demand. Operates over the long term (months–years). Primarily targets out-of-market buyers (the 95%).

**Sales Activation**
Marketing activities that convert existing demand into immediate purchases. Short-term, rational, targeted at in-market buyers (the 5%). Measured by sales uplift, ROAS, CPA.

**The Long and Short of It**
Binet & Field's IPA analysis establishing the evidence base for balancing brand building (long-term) and sales activation (short-term). Key finding: optimal split is approximately 60% brand / 40% activation for most consumer categories.

**60/40 Split**
The evidence-based benchmark for brand vs. activation investment allocation. 60% brand building, 40% activation maximises long-term profit and market share growth for most categories.

**SOV (Share of Voice)**
Your brand's advertising spend as a percentage of total category advertising spend. SOV = your spend ÷ total category spend × 100.

**SOM (Share of Market)**
Your brand's market share within the category.

**ESOV (Excess Share of Voice)**
SOV minus SOM. Positive ESOV = brand is out-investing its market share (likely to grow). Negative ESOV = brand is under-investing (likely to decline). Rule of thumb: each +10 ESOV points = ~0.5 SOM points per year.

**95-5 Rule**
Binet's finding that approximately 95% of category buyers are not in-market at any given time. Only 5% are active buyers. Brand advertising must reach the 95% to build future demand; activation reaches the 5% to convert current demand.

**In-Market Buyers (the 5%)**
Buyers who are currently in an active purchase consideration window. The target of activation / performance marketing.

**Out-of-Market Buyers (the 95%)**
Category buyers who are not currently considering a purchase but will buy in the future. The primary target of brand building advertising.

**Double Jeopardy Law**
Ehrenberg-Bass law: smaller brands have fewer buyers AND those buyers buy less frequently. Both effects are driven by lower penetration. The solution is penetration growth (more buyers), not loyalty programmes.

**Penetration**
The proportion of category buyers who bought the brand at least once in a defined period. The primary driver of market share growth.

**Mental Availability**
The propensity for a brand to be thought of in buying situations (Romaniuk & Sharp). Built through advertising that creates and refreshes memory structures.

**Emotional Advertising**
Advertising that works primarily through emotional responses and memory encoding rather than rational argument. Consistently outperforms rational advertising on long-term effectiveness measures.

**Weak Theory of Advertising**
Ehrenberg's model: advertising works primarily by nudging and maintaining salience, not by strongly persuading. Supports always-on, broad reach brand advertising rather than campaign-by-campaign persuasion.

**Strong Theory of Advertising**
Traditional model: advertising works through rational persuasion, attitude change, and hierarchy of effects (AIDA). More applicable for new products and considered purchases.

**Low Attention Processing (Heath)**
Robert Heath's finding that advertising works even when consumers don't consciously attend to it. Emotional content is particularly effective under low attention.

**Fame Advertising**
Campaigns that generate cultural conversation, sharing, and word of mouth — multiplying the paid media investment with earned media and social amplification. The gold standard of effectiveness.

**ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**
Revenue generated per unit of advertising spend. Primarily measures short-term activation effectiveness. Systematically understates brand building ROI by ignoring long-term effects.

**Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM)**
Statistical analysis that decomposes sales into contributions from different marketing inputs. Captures both short and long-term effects if modelled over sufficient time horizons (2–3 years minimum).

**Short-Termism**
The tendency to prioritise immediately measurable (activation) marketing over long-term (brand building) marketing. Leads to erosion of brand equity, pricing power, and market share over time.

**IPA Effectiveness Databank**
The world's largest database of proven marketing effectiveness evidence, maintained by the UK's Institute of Practitioners in Advertising. The empirical source for Binet & Field's findings.

**Effektsystemet**
A Scandinavian structured approach for evaluating communication effects across four levels: communication effects, brand effects, behaviour effects, and business effects.
