## Defining the Two Types

### Brand Building
**Goal**: Create and refresh mental availability; build emotional associations; grow the potential audience for future purchases.

**Characteristics:**
- Broad audience reach (not just in-market buyers)
- Emotional, non-rational creative
- Long-running or always-on campaigns
- Tells stories, builds feeling, creates culture
- Effects accumulate over months and years
- Hard to attribute in the short term

**What it produces:**
- Increased brand awareness and salience
- Stronger, more positive brand associations
- Higher consideration and preference
- Greater price tolerance (pricing power)
- Larger long-term market share

### Sales Activation
**Goal**: Convert existing demand; prompt in-market buyers to purchase now.

**Characteristics:**
- Targeted at in-market or high-intent audiences
- Rational, message-driven, offer-based
- Burst campaigns aligned to purchase windows
- Includes promotions, limited offers, CTAs
- Effects are immediate and measurable
- Attribution is straightforward (click, coupon, conversion)

**What it produces:**
- Immediate sales uplift
- Short-term revenue spikes
- Conversion of demand already in the funnel
- No lasting change in brand equity or mental availability

## The Danger of Over-Indexing Activation

Because activation is immediately measurable, it tends to win budget allocation battles in data-driven organisations. But the long-term consequences of over-indexing activation are severe:

1. **Mental availability erodes** — Without brand advertising, the brand is gradually forgotten by future buyers
2. **Promotions dependency** — Buyers only purchase when there is an offer; full-price purchases decline
3. **Price erosion** — Promotional discounting becomes the default; margin declines
4. **Competitor gain** — While you harvest existing demand, competitors are building future demand
5. **Brand commoditisation** — Emotional associations weaken; the brand becomes generic

**The "depleting the reservoir" metaphor**: Brand equity is like a reservoir. Activation draws water out; brand building refills it. Cutting brand investment is invisible short-term (the reservoir looks full) but eventually the reservoir runs dry.

## The Danger of Over-Indexing Brand Building

The opposite problem also exists:
- Pure brand building without activation fails to convert demand when it exists
- Awareness and preference that never get converted waste investment
- Seasonality and purchase windows require activation bursts
- New products and promotions need activation to generate trial

## How Brand Building and Activation Interact

The two types of marketing are complementary:
1. **Brand building creates mental availability** → buyers are primed to notice and respond to activation
2. **Activation converts primed demand** → short-term revenue funds more brand investment
3. **Brand equity amplifies activation** → emotionally connected buyers respond more to CTAs and offers
4. The combination is worth more than either alone

**The virtuous cycle:**
```
Brand Building → Mental Availability → Better Activation Response
      ↑                                          |
      |____________ Revenue + Margin _____________|
```

## Diagnostic Questions for Brand vs. Activation Balance

1. What % of your marketing budget is brand building vs. activation?
2. Is your brand building investment continuous or only in bursts?
3. What % of your sales volume is driven by promotions?
4. Are your brand equity metrics (awareness, consideration, preference) stable or declining?
5. Is your price premium vs. category growing, stable, or declining?
6. What is your ESOV vs. main competitors?

If activation > 50% of budget and brand equity metrics are declining → over-indexed on activation.
If brand building > 80% and conversion rates are low → under-invested in activation.
