## The Core Insight

At any given moment, approximately **95% of category buyers are NOT in the market** for a product or service.

Only **5% are active buyers** — currently considering a purchase, comparing options, or ready to buy now.

This is derived from purchase frequency data across categories: if consumers buy a category product once a year, then on any given day only ~1/365 of buyers are in an "active purchase window." Even for higher-frequency categories, the in-market pool is always a small fraction of total buyers.

## Why This Changes Everything About Advertising Strategy

**If you only advertise to in-market buyers (the 5%):**
- You reach a tiny fraction of your potential audience
- You compete in the most crowded, expensive advertising environment (everyone is targeting in-market buyers)
- You generate immediate conversion but do nothing to grow future demand
- You are harvesting existing demand, not creating new demand

**If you also advertise to out-of-market buyers (the 95%):**
- You reach the vast majority of your future buyers
- You build memory structures (brand associations) that will be activated at the future moment of purchase
- You build mental availability — so when a buyer enters the market, your brand comes to mind first
- You create and shape future demand at lower cost (less competitive, earlier in the funnel)

## The Implication for Brand vs. Activation

| Advertising to | Mechanism | Effect on |
|---|---|---|
| The 5% (in-market) | Rational persuasion, prompting | Immediate conversion — activation |
| The 95% (out of market) | Memory building, emotional association | Future demand — brand building |

**Key principle**: Advertising to the 95% is brand building. Advertising to the 5% is activation. Both are needed; but the 95% should receive the majority of brand investment because they represent the majority of future buyers.

## The Problem With Performance Marketing Alone

Performance marketing (search, retargeting, social direct response) is optimised to reach in-market buyers — the 5%. It is:
- Highly measurable (clicks, conversions, ROAS)
- Apparently very efficient (you only pay when someone engages)
- Easy to justify to finance/CFO

But performance marketing:
- Does not reach the 95% who are not yet searching or clicking
- Does not build the memory structures that cause buyers to search for your brand in the first place
- Creates a "demand harvesting" loop with diminishing returns as the in-market pool is exhausted
- Eventually drives up CPCs as more competitors chase the same small pool

**Brand advertising creates the demand that performance marketing then harvests.** Without brand investment, performance marketing efficiency eventually collapses.

## Category-Level Variation

The 95-5 split varies by category purchase frequency:

| Category | Estimated In-Market % at Any Time |
|---|---|
| FMCG (weekly purchase) | ~14% |
| Insurance (annual) | ~2% |
| Car purchase (every 3–5 years) | <1% |
| B2B software (annual budget cycles) | ~5% |
| Restaurant choice (daily) | ~30–50% |

For low-frequency categories (financial services, automotive, B2B), the case for brand building is even stronger — the in-market window is tiny and infrequent.

## Practical Implications for Media Strategy

1. **Allocate brand investment to reach the 95%** — broad reach media, always-on, emotional
2. **Allocate activation investment to reach the 5%** — search, retargeting, intent-based targeting
3. **Never cut brand investment because "most people aren't buying right now"** — that is precisely why you need brand investment
4. **Measure the impact of brand investment on future purchase intent** — track brand metrics as leading indicators
5. **Evaluate ROAS sceptically** — it measures the 5% only; it systematically understates total advertising return
