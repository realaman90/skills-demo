**Authors:** Les Binet & Peter Field (IPA)

The full slide deck for "The Long and Short of It" — the most influential presentation in modern marketing effectiveness. Analyses hundreds of IPA Effectiveness Award entries to establish that the industry systematically underinvests in brand building in favour of short-term activation. Key findings: 60/40 brand/activation split maximises long-term profit; ESOV drives SOM growth; emotional campaigns outperform rational campaigns on long-term measures; short-termism is eroding industry effectiveness.

## 4. advertising-effectiveness-and-the-95-5-rule.pdf
**File:** docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/advertising-effectiveness-and-the-95-5-rule.pdf
**Author:** Les Binet

Introduces the 95-5 Rule: at any given moment, approximately 95% of category buyers are not in-market. Only 5% are active buyers. Argues that most performance and digital advertising is optimised for the 5% while ignoring the 95%. Brand advertising must reach the 95% to build future demand. Challenges the dominance of performance marketing ROI metrics that only capture in-market conversion.

## 5. Double_Jeopardy.pdf
**File:** docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/Double_Jeopardy.pdf
**Authors:** Ehrenberg-Bass Institute

Research establishing and extending the Double Jeopardy Law: smaller brands have fewer buyers AND those buyers buy less frequently. Both effects are mathematical consequences of lower penetration. Growth strategy must prioritise penetration (new buyer acquisition) over loyalty deepening. Broad reach advertising targeting all category buyers is more effective for growth than loyalty-focused programmes.

## 6. How_Advertising_Works_What_Do_We_Really.pdf

A research synthesis on advertising mechanisms — what does the evidence actually say about how advertising creates effects? Covers the weak vs. strong theory debate, the role of emotion vs. rational argument, low attention processing (Heath), and the evidence for memory-building as the primary mechanism. Challenges the traditional persuasion model and supports the emotional/associative model.

**File:** docs/newskills/10_Marketing_Effectiveness/Advertising Strongly Persuasive or Nudging.pdf

Empirical research comparing the "strongly persuasive" vs. "nudging" models of advertising effectiveness. Finds that most advertising effects are closer to nudging — small, cumulative shifts in preference and salience — rather than strong attitude conversion. Supports always-on, consistent brand advertising over occasional high-impact persuasion campaigns.

(3) behaviour effects — did purchasing change? (4) business effects — did financial outcomes improve? Widely used in Scandinavian market research and effectiveness reporting.
