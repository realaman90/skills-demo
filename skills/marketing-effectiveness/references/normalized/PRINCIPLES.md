# Marketing Effectiveness — Core Principles

## The Effectiveness Crisis

The marketing industry has drifted toward short-termism. Pressure for immediate, measurable ROI has led brands to over-invest in performance and activation marketing at the expense of brand building. The result: campaigns that generate short-term spikes but fail to build lasting competitive advantage.

The IPA Effectiveness Databank (the largest repository of proven marketing effectiveness evidence) consistently shows that the most effective campaigns combine brand building and sales activation — not one or the other.

## The Two Types of Marketing Effect

| Type | Mechanism | Timeframe | Metric | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Brand building** | Emotional associations, mental availability | Long-term (months–years) | Market share, penetration, price premium | Grows the market, builds equity |
| **Sales activation** | Rational prompts, calls to action | Short-term (days–weeks) | Sales uplift, conversion | Converts existing demand |

**Key insight**: Brand building creates demand; activation converts it. You cannot convert demand that hasn't been created.

## The 60/40 Principle (Binet & Field)

Analysis of IPA Effectiveness Award winners shows the optimal long-term balance for most consumer brands is:
- **~60% brand building** (long-term emotional campaigns)
- **~40% sales activation** (short-term rational/promotional)

This ratio varies by category:
- Fast-moving consumer goods: closer to 60/40
- Considered purchases (cars, financial services): brand building can exceed 70%
- B2B: brand building often 46%, activation 54% (shorter cycles, smaller audiences)

The 60/40 is a guide, not a law — the principle is that underinvesting in brand building damages long-term effectiveness.

## Why Brand Building Works Differently to Activation

**Brand building:**
- Works by creating and refreshing memory structures
- Reaches people who are NOT currently in the market
- Effects accumulate over time (stock of mental availability)
- Is harder to measure in the short term (the effect shows up later)
- Creates future demand and pricing power

**Sales activation:**
- Works by prompting people who ARE currently in the market
- Reaches people ready to buy
- Effects are immediate and measurable
- Effects decay quickly (no lasting change in memory structures)
- Converts existing demand but does not grow it

## The Short-Termism Trap

When brands cut brand building in favour of activation:
- Short-term sales may hold (for a while)
- But mental availability erodes — the brand is gradually forgotten
- Price sensitivity increases as emotional associations weaken
- The brand becomes dependent on promotions and discounting to drive volume
- Long-term market share and margin decline

The damage of cutting brand investment is often invisible for 12–18 months — which is why it is politically easy to cut and hard to defend.

## Key Effectiveness Principles Summary

1. **Balance brand and activation** — 60/40 is the evidence-based benchmark
2. **Reach the 95%** — Most buyers are not in market; brand advertising builds future demand
3. **Growth comes from penetration** — Attract new buyers, don't just deepen loyalty
4. **Emotional advertising works** — It builds associations that rational advertising cannot
5. **ESOV drives share growth** — Brands that out-invest competitors in SOV grow share
6. **Measure both short and long** — Short-term metrics miss most of the effect
7. **Fame advertising is most efficient** — Ads that get talked about multiply their media spend
