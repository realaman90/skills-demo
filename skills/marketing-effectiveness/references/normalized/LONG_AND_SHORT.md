## Background

Les Binet and Peter Field analysed over 1,400 IPA Effectiveness Award entries — the largest database of proven marketing effectiveness evidence in existence. Their findings revealed that the industry had significantly underestimated the importance of long-term brand building relative to short-term activation.

## The Five Key Findings

### 1. Brand Building and Activation Work Differently
- **Brand building** is broad reach, emotional, long-term
- **Activation** is targeted, rational, short-term
- Both are necessary; neither alone is optimal

### 2. The Optimal Split Is ~60% Brand / ~40% Activation
- Analysed across hundreds of effective campaigns
- The 60/40 split maximises long-term profit and market share
- Brands over-investing in activation suffer long-term share and margin erosion
- The optimal split varies by category and competitive context

### 3. Emotional Advertising Builds Long-Term Effects
- Emotional campaigns outperform rational campaigns on long-term measures
- Strong emotional response generates stronger and more durable memory encoding
- "Fame" campaigns (that get shared and talked about) are particularly powerful
- Emotional effects compound over time; rational effects decay

### 4. Brand Metrics Lead Business Metrics
- Awareness, consideration, preference, and trust → lead indicators of future sales
- If brand metrics are declining, business performance will follow (with lag)
- Measuring only sales response misses the leading indicators of marketing health

### 5. Share of Voice (SOV) Predicts Share of Market (SOM)
- Brands that maintain SOV above their SOM grow their SOM over time
- Excess Share of Voice (ESOV) = SOV – SOM (positive = growing brand)
- For every 10 points of ESOV, brands typically gain ~0.5 points of market share per year
- Cutting advertising spend reduces SOV → eventually reduces SOM

## ESOV — Excess Share of Voice

**Share of Voice (SOV)** = Your advertising spend ÷ total category advertising spend × 100

**Share of Market (SOM)** = Your market share

**ESOV** = SOV – SOM

| ESOV | Implication |
|---|---|
| Positive (SOV > SOM) | Brand is likely to gain market share |
| Zero (SOV = SOM) | Brand will hold market share |
| Negative (SOV < SOM) | Brand is likely to lose market share |

**Strategic use**: Challenger brands can attack by achieving high ESOV even with small budgets (relative to market leaders). Small brands with positive ESOV are growing.

## The Short-Term vs. Long-Term Effect Split

Econometric studies consistently find:
- ~40% of advertising effects are short-term (within 2 weeks of exposure)
- ~60% of advertising effects are long-term (over months and years)

Marketing ROI studies that measure only 4-week or 13-week response periods miss most of the value. This is a key reason why effectiveness is systematically underreported.

## Implications for Media Planning

- **Brand building channels**: TV, online video, broad reach media — high emotional impact, broad audience
- **Activation channels**: Search, email, social performance — precise targeting, intent-based response
- Brand building investment should run continuously (always-on) to maintain mental availability
- Activation should be deployed in bursts aligned with purchase cycles and seasonality

## Category Variations in Optimal Split

| Category | Approximate Brand % | Approximate Activation % |
|---|---|---|
| FMCG | 60% | 40% |
| Retail | 55% | 45% |
| Financial services | 65–70% | 30–35% |
| Automotive | 65–70% | 30–35% |
| B2B | 46% | 54% |
| Technology | 55% | 45% |

Note: These are indicative benchmarks from IPA data. Actual optimal splits depend on brand maturity, competitive dynamics, and business objectives.

## The Fame Multiplier

"Fame" campaigns — those that create cultural conversation, are shared, and become talked about — achieve a multiplier effect on media investment:
- Earned media amplifies paid media (organic sharing extends reach)
- Social proof increases brand associations in non-exposed audiences
- Fame compounds over time (cultural references have longer half-lives than ads)

Fame campaigns typically score highest on both short-term activation AND long-term brand building — making them the gold standard of effectiveness.
