## Key Frameworks

1. **Long and Short of It** (Binet & Field): Brand building (60%) + Activation (40%) → optimal long-term effectiveness
2. **ESOV → SOM**: Excess Share of Voice drives Share of Market growth (~0.5 SOM per 10 ESOV points)
3. **95-5 Rule** (Binet): 95% out-of-market (brand target) + 5% in-market (activation target)
4. **Double Jeopardy** (Ehrenberg-Bass): Smaller brands → fewer buyers + lower frequency → penetration is the growth lever
5. **Weak Theory of Advertising** (Ehrenberg): Advertising nudges and maintains salience; it does not strongly persuade
6. **Two-Horizon Measurement**: Short-term (0–13 weeks, activation metrics) + Long-term (6 months–3 years, brand metrics)
7. **Effektsystemet Cascade**: Communication effects → Brand effects → Behaviour effects → Business effects
8. **Fame Advertising**: Earned media multiplier on paid media investment — the gold standard of effectiveness
