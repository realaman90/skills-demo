# ASSIGNMENT GUIDE: Marketing Effectiveness

## Your role vs. the AI's role

**You** evaluate the real marketing investment decisions. **The skill** applies the evidence base.

The skill has access to Binet & Field's IPA analysis, the 95-5 rule, Double Jeopardy, and the full effectiveness literature. What it cannot assess is your brand's actual budget split, its ESOV position vs. competitors, its brand equity trend, or why specific campaigns did or did not work. That requires your analysis of real data.

## What this skill covers

- The Long and Short of It (Binet & Field): brand building vs. sales activation, the 60/40 split
- ESOV (Excess Share of Voice) as a predictor of market share change
- The 95-5 Rule: in-market buyers (5%) vs. future buyers (95%)
- Double Jeopardy: why penetration drives growth, not loyalty
- How advertising works: emotional vs. rational mechanisms, weak theory vs. strong theory
- Measurement: two-horizon framework (short-term + long-term), MMM, brand tracking

## Before you open the skill

Do this yourself first:

1. Estimate the brand's current budget split: what % goes to brand building (broad reach, emotional) vs. sales activation (performance, conversion)?
2. Estimate the brand's Share of Voice vs. its Share of Market. Is ESOV positive or negative?
3. Is the brand's advertising primarily reaching in-market buyers (the 5%) or also reaching non-buyers and light buyers (the 95%)?
4. What are the brand's long-term equity metrics (awareness, consideration, preference)? Are they trending up, flat, or down?
5. Is the brand measuring effectiveness only on short-term ROAS — or also on long-term brand metrics?

---

## Suggested workflow

1. Complete your own effectiveness audit: budget split, ESOV estimate, measurement gaps
2. Use the skill in **learn mode**: share your audit and ask it to challenge your numbers and assumptions
3. Use **diagnose mode** to apply the Long and Short framework to your brand's situation
4. Use **strategy mode** to build the recommended investment rebalancing case
5. Use **measure mode** to design the full two-horizon measurement framework
6. Write your assignment — cite Binet & Field, Ehrenberg-Bass (Double Jeopardy), and the 95-5 source paper

## What the skill will probe you on (learn mode)

- What is your evidence for the current budget split? Is it documented or estimated?
- Your ESOV — have you calculated actual share of voice against total category spend?
- You say activation is "working" — are you measuring only the 5% in-market, or also future demand building?
- What is your brand equity trend over the past 3 years? Is it stable or declining?
- How would you make the financial case for brand investment to a CFO who only measures short-term ROAS?

---

## What your examiner will ask

- "What is the evidence-based case for investing in brand building rather than pure performance marketing? Apply it to your brand's current situation."
- "Calculate or estimate your brand's ESOV. What does it predict for market share in 12 months?"
- "Apply the 95-5 rule. Is this brand's media strategy reaching the out-of-market majority or only harvesting current demand?"
- "Apply Double Jeopardy. Is this brand's growth strategy penetration-led or loyalty-led? Which does the evidence support?"
- "How would you redesign this brand's measurement framework to capture both short-term and long-term effectiveness?"

## Academic integrity note

An effectiveness analysis that only cites Binet & Field's 60/40 principle without applying it to actual data is not analysis — it is citation. Your assignment must show the brand's actual position: real or estimated budget splits, real or estimated ESOV, real brand equity trend data. The frameworks are lenses. You must provide the subject matter they are applied to.
