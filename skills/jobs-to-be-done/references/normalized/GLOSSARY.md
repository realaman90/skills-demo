# GLOSSARY

## Jobs-to-be-Done Terminology

### Job to Be Done (JTBD)
The progress a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance. Defined by Christensen as "the fundamental problem a customer needs to resolve in a given situation." The unit of analysis in JTBD strategy.

### Job Statement
A structured description of a job: [Verb] + [Object] + [Circumstance]. Example: "Get through my morning commute without feeling hungry or distracted." Should not reference a product, brand, or feature.

### Circumstance
The specific context — when, where, with whom, and in what emotional state — in which a job arises. The same person has different jobs in different circumstances.

### Hire / Fire
The metaphor for a customer's decision to purchase (hire) or stop using (fire) a product. Products are hired when they best solve the job; fired when a better alternative appears or the product fails the job.

### Functional Job Dimension
The practical task or outcome the customer wants to accomplish. The "what needs to get done?" dimension.

### Emotional Job Dimension
How the customer wants to feel while doing or after completing the job. The "how do I want to feel?" dimension.

### Social Job Dimension
How the customer wants to be perceived by others as a result of doing the job. The "how do I want to be seen?" dimension.

### Competing Solution
Any product, service, workaround, or non-consumption that a customer could hire to do the same job. JTBD competition is broader than traditional product-category competition.

### Switch Trigger
An event or frustration that causes a customer to begin searching for a new solution to a job. The "push" away from the current solution.

### Four Forces of Progress
The four forces that influence whether a customer switches to a new solution:
1. **Push**: Frustration or dissatisfaction with the current solution.
2. **Pull**: Attraction to the benefits of a new solution.
3. **Habit**: Comfort and inertia with the familiar.
4. **Anxiety**: Fear or uncertainty about whether the new solution will work.

### Job Map
A step-by-step breakdown of the stages a customer goes through when executing a job: Define → Locate → Prepare → Confirm → Execute → Monitor → Modify → Conclude. Used to identify friction points and innovation opportunities at each stage.

### Desired Outcome
A specific, measurable result the customer wants to achieve while executing a job. Format: [Direction] + [Metric] + [Object of control] + [Clarifier]. Used in Ulwick's outcome-based segmentation.

### Outcome-Based Segmentation
Segmenting customers by the outcomes they most want to achieve (and are least satisfied with currently) — rather than by demographics, psychographics, or product usage. Developed by Tony Ulwick.

### Opportunity Score
A metric used in outcome-based segmentation: `Importance + max(Importance – Satisfaction, 0)`. High scores indicate outcomes that are important to customers but poorly served by current solutions — the highest innovation priority.

### Benefit Segmentation
A segmentation approach that groups customers by the benefits they seek from a product. A precursor to JTBD segmentation — closer to job-based than demographic, but still product-centric rather than circumstance-based.

### Non-Consumer
A person who has the job but does not currently purchase any solution in the product category — because no existing solution serves the job well enough. Non-consumers represent the largest growth opportunity in JTBD thinking.

### Marketing Malpractice
Christensen's term for the common failure of companies to create and market products by product attribute rather than by customer job — resulting in innovations that don't match any real job and fail in market.

### Switch Interview
The primary qualitative research method in JTBD — interviewing customers who recently made a purchase switch to uncover the job, circumstance, competing solutions, and switch triggers that drove the decision.
