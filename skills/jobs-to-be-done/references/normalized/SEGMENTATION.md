# SEGMENTATION

## JTBD-Based Segmentation: Segment by Job, Not by Demographics

---

### Why Traditional Segmentation Fails
- Demographic segmentation (age, gender, income, geography) groups customers who may want very different things.
- Psychographic segmentation (attitudes, values, lifestyle) is notoriously hard to link to actual purchase behaviour.
- Product attribute segmentation ("who buys our premium tier?") describes what they buy — not why.

### Benefit Segmentation
- Benefit segmentation groups customers by the benefits or outcomes they seek — a step closer to JTBD.
- Developed by Haley (1968) and refined as a decision tool.
- Better than demographics because benefits relate more directly to purchase motivation.
- Limitation: benefits are still product-centric ("I want a whiter smile") rather than job-centric ("I want to feel confident in job interviews").

### Outcome-Based Segmentation (Ulwick)
- Tony Ulwick's approach: segment customers by the outcomes they are trying to achieve in getting the job done.
- An "outcome" is a specific, measurable result the customer wants — expressed in their terms, not the company's.
- Outcome statement format: **[Direction] + [Metric] + [Object of control] + [Clarifier]**
  - Example: "Minimise the time it takes to identify the root cause of a system failure."
  - Example: "Increase the likelihood that the document is formatted correctly the first time."
- Outcome-based segmentation reveals which customer groups are over-served, under-served, or appropriately served.

### The Opportunity Landscape
After mapping outcomes and surveying importance + satisfaction:
- **Over-served segments**: Customers satisfied with current solutions for low-importance outcomes — price-sensitive, vulnerable to disruption.
- **Under-served segments**: Customers who rate outcomes as highly important but poorly satisfied — the innovation opportunity.
- **Appropriately served**: Customers satisfied on what matters — maintain, don't over-invest.

Plotting outcomes on an Opportunity Score matrix:
> Opportunity Score = Importance + max(Importance – Satisfaction, 0)
- High opportunity score = under-served outcome = innovation priority.

### Job-Based Market Definition
- JTBD expands the market definition beyond category competitors.
- A market is defined by the job, not the product category.
- Example: The "help me get through a boring commute" market includes podcasts, audiobooks, radio, milkshakes, and phone calls — not just other beverages.
- This reveals non-obvious competitors and white-space opportunities.

### How to Segment by Job in Practice

**Step 1**: Identify the top 3–5 distinct jobs customers hire your category to do.

**Step 2**: For each job, profile:
- The circumstance (when/where/with whom)
- The desired functional, emotional, and social outcomes
- The current competing solutions hired for the job
- The switch triggers (what gets current solutions fired)

**Step 3**: Survey customers on importance and satisfaction of desired outcomes within each job.

**Step 4**: Plot outcomes on opportunity matrix — identify the under-served job-segments.

**Step 5**: Prioritise: which job-segment is large enough, under-served enough, and matches our capabilities?

**Step 6**: Design the product, service, and brand positioning to serve the prioritised job-segment.
