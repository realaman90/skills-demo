### The Central Insight: People Hire Products to Do Jobs
- Customers do not buy products or services — they hire them to make progress in specific circumstances.
- A "job" is the progress a person is trying to make in a particular situation.
- When a product does the job well, the customer keeps hiring it. When a better alternative appears, they fire it.
- This reframes the unit of analysis from "which customers buy us?" to "what job are customers hiring us for?"

### The Job, Not the Customer, Is the Unit of Analysis
- Traditional marketing segments customers by demographics or psychographics — people with similar profiles.
- JTBD argues this is misleading: people with identical demographics hire very different products for very different jobs.
- The job is stable; the customer population that has the job is diverse.
- Example: A 65-year-old retired professor and a 19-year-old student may hire the same milkshake for the same job — a filling, convenient morning commute companion.

### The Three Dimensions of a Job
Every job has three dimensions:
1. **Functional**: The practical task or outcome the customer wants to achieve ("get through my morning commute without being hungry").
2. **Emotional**: How the customer wants to feel during or after the job ("feel in control", "feel rewarded", "feel confident").
3. **Social**: How the customer wants to be perceived by others ("look responsible", "appear innovative", "be seen as a good parent").
- All three dimensions must be understood to design a product or message that fully does the job.

### Circumstance Defines the Job
- The same person can have different jobs in different circumstances.
- A job is always defined by: the progress desired + the circumstance in which it arises.
- Example: "Get lunch" is too broad. "Get a filling lunch I can eat while driving to my 1pm meeting" is a specific job with a circumstance.
- Brands that understand the circumstance can design experiences that precisely serve the job.

### The Hire / Fire Metaphor
- Customers "hire" a product when it is the best available solution for the job in that circumstance.
- They "fire" a product when a better alternative emerges, when the job changes, or when the product fails to do the job.
- Understanding what causes switching (what gets a product fired) reveals unmet needs and innovation opportunities.

### Competing Solutions vs. Competing Brands
- In JTBD, the competition for a job is not other brands in the same product category — it is all solutions a customer could hire for the same job.
- The milkshake's competition is: bananas, bagels, a cup of coffee, a granola bar — not other milkshakes.
- This radically expands the definition of competition and opens new innovation and positioning strategies.

### Why Traditional Marketing Fails (Malpractice)
- Christensen argues most companies create products and segment markets by product attribute — not by job.
- This leads to over-engineered products that do not match any specific job, or products targeted at the wrong customers.
- "Marketing malpractice" occurs when companies focus on making better products rather than solving better jobs.
- Innovation and brand growth require first understanding the job, then designing the solution.
