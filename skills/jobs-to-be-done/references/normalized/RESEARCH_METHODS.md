## How to Research Jobs to Be Done

---

### The Switch Interview (Primary JTBD Research Method)
The switch interview uncovers the job, circumstance, and switch triggers by focusing on a real purchase decision:

**Recruit**: Find people who recently purchased or switched to your product (or a competitor's).

**Interview structure** — follow the timeline backward:
1. "Tell me about the day you first realised the current solution wasn't working for you."
   → Reveals the Push (frustration with current solution)
2. "What were you doing when you first started looking for alternatives?"
   → Reveals the trigger circumstance
3. "What other options did you consider?"
   → Reveals the competing solutions
4. "What was it about [new product] that made you decide to hire it?"
   → Reveals the Pull (attraction to new solution)
5. "Was there anything that almost stopped you from making the switch?"
   → Reveals Anxiety and Habit forces
6. "What were you hoping would be different once you started using it?"
   → Reveals the desired job outcomes

**Key principle**: Follow the story, not a rigid script. The goal is to understand the emotional and circumstantial context of the decision.

### Outcome-Based Surveys (Ulwick's Method)
Used when quantitative data is needed to prioritise outcomes and segment by job.

**Step 1**: Run qualitative JTBD interviews (10–20) to generate a complete list of desired outcomes for a job.

**Step 2**: Structure outcome statements in the standard format:
> [Direction verb] + [metric] + [object of control] + [clarifier]
- "Minimise the time it takes to onboard a new team member"
- "Increase the likelihood that the report is accurate the first time"
- "Reduce the effort required to track project status across multiple tools"

**Step 3**: Survey 100–200 customers (and non-customers) per outcome:
- "How important is this outcome to you?" (1–10 scale)
- "How satisfied are you with current solutions for this outcome?" (1–10 scale)

**Step 4**: Calculate Opportunity Score: `Importance + max(Importance – Satisfaction, 0)`

**Step 5**: Plot on opportunity matrix and identify highest-priority outcomes for innovation.

### Contextual Observation
- Watch customers in the actual circumstances where the job arises — before, during, and after.
- What workarounds do they use? Where do they struggle? What do they do right before and after?
- Observation uncovers jobs that customers can't articulate in interviews (latent needs).

### Non-Consumer Research
- Interview people who are NOT buying from the category to understand the job they have that current solutions don't serve.
- Non-consumers represent the largest untapped growth opportunity — they have the job but no good solution.
- The question to ask: "What are you doing today to try to solve this problem?" → reveals workarounds that define the non-consumer's job.

### Common Research Mistakes in JTBD
- **Asking "what features do you want?"**: Leads to customers asking for more of what they already have, not revealing the job.
- **Focusing on satisfaction with current products**: Satisfaction data tells you how well you're doing the current job — not what jobs remain unserved.
- **Using demographics to recruit interview participants**: Recruit by job (people who recently made a relevant switch or purchase) — not by demographic profile.
- **Asking hypothetical questions**: "Would you use X if we built it?" → customers are poor at predicting future behaviour. Focus on real past decisions.
- **Stopping at the functional job**: Always probe emotional and social dimensions — they often determine the actual purchase decision.
