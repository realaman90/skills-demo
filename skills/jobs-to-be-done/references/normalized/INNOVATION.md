# INNOVATION

## Using JTBD to Drive Innovation

---

### The JTBD Innovation Principle
- Successful innovation solves an important, under-served job better than current alternatives.
- Failed innovation typically adds features to an existing product without addressing a specific job.
- The question is never "what features should we add?" — it is "what job is under-served, and how can we serve it better?"

### Disruptive Innovation Through JTBD
- Disruption often happens when a new entrant serves a job that incumbents are ignoring — usually a job done by a non-consumption or a workaround.
- Incumbent brands focus on serving heavy users of existing products — but the job-based approach reveals light users or non-consumers who have an unmet job.
- Example: Online banking didn't start by competing with full-service banks — it served the job "manage routine transactions without going to a branch" for people who found branches inconvenient.

### Types of Innovation Through JTBD Lens

| Innovation Type | JTBD Application |
|---|---|
| New product | Serve a previously unserved job with a purpose-built solution |
| Product extension | Serve the same job in a new circumstance |
| Feature addition | Improve satisfaction of a specific under-served outcome within an existing job |
| Disruption | Serve a job currently done by non-consumption or inferior workarounds |
| Repositioning | Reframe an existing product as the solution to a different, larger job |

### Identifying Innovation Opportunities: The Opportunity Algorithm (Ulwick)
1. Survey customers: For each desired outcome — "How important is this to you?" and "How satisfied are you with current solutions?"
2. Calculate Opportunity Score per outcome: `Importance + max(Importance – Satisfaction, 0)`
3. Rank outcomes by Opportunity Score — high scores = under-served innovation priorities.
4. Design innovation to maximally satisfy the highest-opportunity outcomes.

### The Job Map as an Innovation Roadmap
- Walk through each stage of the job map (Define → Locate → Prepare → Confirm → Execute → Monitor → Modify → Conclude).
- At each stage, ask: Where do current solutions cause friction? Where do customers waste time or effort?
- Innovation can target any stage — not just the core execution step.
- Example: A software company may find the biggest pain is in the "Prepare" stage (onboarding and setup) — innovation here may unlock more value than feature improvements.

### Avoiding Innovation Malpractice
- Do not add features that no customer job requires — this creates complexity without value.
- Do not build products for the "average" customer — average customers have average (often non-existent) jobs.
- Do not define innovation success by feature count — define it by how well the job is now served.
- Do not let internal product roadmaps dictate the job — the job is defined by the customer's desired progress, not the engineering team's capabilities.

### JTBD and Adjacent Job Expansion
- Once a brand owns one job well, it can grow by:
  1. Serving the same job in more circumstances.
  2. Serving adjacent jobs the same customer has.
  3. Serving the same job for more customer segments.
- Example: A project management tool hired for "keep my small team aligned" can expand to serve "keep enterprise departments aligned" — same job, different circumstance and scale.
