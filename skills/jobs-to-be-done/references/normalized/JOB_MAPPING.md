## How to Identify and Map Jobs to Be Done

---

### Step 1: Suspend Product Thinking
- Do not start with "what features does our product have?"
- Ask: "What is the customer trying to accomplish — and what does their life look like before and after they accomplish it?"
- Remove brand and category labels from the conversation.

### Step 2: Define the Job Statement
A proper job statement has this structure:
> **[Verb] + [Object] + [Circumstance / Context]**

Examples:
- "Get through my commute without feeling hungry or distracted" (not "buy a milkshake")
- "Impress my client during a pitch without the tech failing" (not "buy a projector")
- "Keep my team aligned on priorities without spending hours in meetings" (not "buy project management software")

Avoid job statements that:
- Reference the product or brand ("buy a faster X")
- Are too broad ("be healthier")
- Are too narrow and feature-specific ("sync files in real time")

### Step 3: Identify the Circumstance
For every job, define the circumstance:
- **When** does this job arise? (time of day, season, trigger event)
- **Where** is the customer? (commuting, at a desk, at a client site)
- **Who** else is involved? (alone, with team, with client)
- **What emotional state** is the customer in? (stressed, excited, distracted)
- **What are the constraints**? (time pressure, budget, technical limitations)

### Step 4: Map Competing Solutions
For the identified job + circumstance, list ALL solutions the customer could hire — not just product category competitors:
- Current workarounds and alternatives
- Adjacent categories
- DIY solutions
- "Do nothing" as a valid competitor

### Step 5: Identify Functional, Emotional, and Social Dimensions

| Dimension | Question to Ask | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Functional | What task does the customer need to complete? | Get a filling meal quickly |
| Emotional | How does the customer want to feel? | Feel in control, not rushed |
| Social | How does the customer want to be seen? | Look professional to colleagues |

### Step 6: Map the Job Journey (Job Map)
Break the job into stages the customer goes through:
1. **Define** — figuring out what they need
2. **Locate** — finding the inputs/resources
3. **Prepare** — setting up the context
4. **Confirm** — verifying everything is in place
5. **Execute** — carrying out the core task
6. **Monitor** — checking progress
7. **Modify** — adjusting as needed
8. **Conclude** — completing and wrapping up

At each stage, identify: What are the desired outcomes? What are the pain points? Where do current solutions fail?

### Step 7: Identify Switch Triggers (Hire/Fire Moments)
- What causes a customer to start looking for a new solution? (the "push")
- What new solution attracts them away? (the "pull")
- What holds them back from switching? (habits, anxieties, switching costs)
- The Four Forces of Progress model:
  - **Push**: Frustration with current solution
  - **Pull**: Attraction to new solution
  - **Habit**: Comfort with the familiar
  - **Anxiety**: Fear of the new being worse

Understanding these four forces reveals where innovation and messaging should focus.
