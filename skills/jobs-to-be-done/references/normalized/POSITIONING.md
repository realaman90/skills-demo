# POSITIONING

## JTBD-Based Brand Positioning

---

### The JTBD Positioning Principle
- A brand's positioning should claim a specific job — it should tell the customer: "Hire us when you need to make this specific progress."
- Positioning that targets demographics ("for young professionals") or vague values ("we care about quality") does not connect to a job.
- The strongest positioning connects the brand directly to the job, the circumstance, and the desired outcomes.

### The Job-Based Positioning Statement
Structure:
> When [circumstance], hire [brand] to [job — functional + emotional + social outcome].

Examples:
- "When you need to get your remote team working together without confusion, hire Slack to make sure nothing falls through the cracks and everyone feels informed."
- "When you're starting a long commute and need to stay focused without getting hungry, hire [Brand] to keep you fuelled and mentally present."
- "When your CFO demands cost visibility by end of quarter, hire [Platform] to give you real-time spend data without a six-month implementation."

### Why Job-Based Positioning Outperforms Feature-Based Positioning
- Feature-based positioning ("the fastest", "most integrations", "best UX") forces the brand into a comparison game — easily matched or beaten.
- Job-based positioning defines the category of need — the brand becomes the shorthand for the job itself.
- When a brand owns a job in buyers' minds, competitors are evaluated against the brand's standard, not the reverse.

### Connecting JTBD Positioning to Mental Availability
- A JTBD-informed positioning naturally produces Category Entry Points (CEPs) — the circumstances become CEPs.
- Advertising built on job-based positioning links the brand to the buying situation in buyer memory.
- This integrates JTBD strategy with mental availability tactics (see `mental-availability-cep` skill).

### Repositioning Using JTBD
If a brand is under-performing, JTBD analysis may reveal:
1. The brand is positioned for a job customers don't actually have.
2. The brand is positioned for a low-volume or low-importance job.
3. Competitors have occupied the most valuable job, but adjacent jobs are available.
4. The product already does a larger job than the brand claims — repositioning unlocks latent demand.

Steps to reposition:
1. Run JTBD research (interviews, switch story analysis) to identify the actual jobs being hired for.
2. Assess which jobs are most important, most under-served, and most aligned with the brand's strengths.
3. Rewrite positioning around the target job + circumstance.
4. Ensure advertising communicates the circumstance and the job — not just the brand attributes.

### JTBD and Brand Architecture
- Multi-product brands can organise their portfolio by jobs: each product line serves a distinct job.
- Prevents cannibalisation by ensuring products are not competing for the same job.
- Enables clearer segmentation: "product A is for job X, product B is for job Y."
- Example: A professional services firm offers strategy consulting (job: "figure out where to go next") vs. implementation services (job: "get the change done without disrupting operations").

### Emotional and Social Job Dimensions in Positioning
- Advertising that only addresses the functional job misses the emotional and social dimensions.
- The most powerful brand positions connect all three: "we help you accomplish X (functional), feel Y (emotional), and be seen as Z (social)."
- Luxury brands are extreme cases: the functional job is often minimal; the emotional and social jobs dominate.
