- normalized/SEGMENTATION.md — JTBD segmentation (benefit segmentation, outcome-based segmentation, opportunity landscape, market definition)
- normalized/INNOVATION.md — Using JTBD for innovation (disruptive innovation, opportunity algorithm, job map as roadmap, avoiding malpractice)
- normalized/POSITIONING.md — JTBD-based brand positioning (job-based positioning statement, vs. feature-based, repositioning, architecture)
- normalized/RESEARCH_METHODS.md — Switch interview, outcome-based survey, observation, non-consumer research, common mistakes
- normalized/GLOSSARY.md — JTBD terminology (job, hire/fire, four forces, job map, outcome, opportunity score, etc.)
- normalized/PDF_SUMMARIES.md — PDF source summaries with topics and OCR status
- normalized/SOURCE_QUOTES.md — Quote bank from source docs for citations

## Gaps
- Direct verbatim text extraction from PDFs is limited. Enable OCR (ENABLE_OCR=1) for better extraction.
- Industry-specific job examples beyond those provided can be generated using web_search if needed.
- Ulwick's full Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI) methodology has additional steps beyond what is summarised here — refer to source PDF for complete detail.
