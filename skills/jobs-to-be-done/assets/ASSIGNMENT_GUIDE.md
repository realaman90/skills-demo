# ASSIGNMENT GUIDE: Jobs to Be Done

## Your role vs. the AI's role

**You** discover the job. **The skill** helps you frame it.

The JTBD framework is a research methodology first. The skill knows the theory — Christensen's four forces, functional/emotional/social job dimensions, job mapping. But the actual job your chosen brand's customers are hiring it to do must come from you: from observation, interviews, or careful analysis of customer behaviour.

## What this skill covers

- The Jobs to Be Done framework (Christensen)
- The four forces: push of the current situation, pull of the new solution, anxiety about switching, attachment to the existing
- Functional, emotional, and social job dimensions
- Job mapping: steps from job trigger to completion
- JTBD-based segmentation vs. demographic segmentation
- Using JTBD for innovation and positioning

## Before you open the skill

Do this yourself first:

1. Pick a specific product or service. Identify one key customer segment.
2. Describe the situation that triggers purchase — not demographically, but circumstantially. What is happening in their life?
3. What are they trying to get done? Write three versions: functional ("I need to..."), emotional ("I want to feel..."), social ("I want others to see me as...").
4. What did they do before this product existed? What were they "hiring" as a workaround?
5. What would cause them to "fire" this product? What job would go unfulfilled?

If you haven't done at least 3 customer interviews or close observation, you are guessing. The JTBD framework is only as good as the customer insight underneath it.

## Suggested workflow

1. Conduct or review customer research — at minimum read case studies, reviews, or sales call notes
2. Write your initial job statement: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]"
3. Use the skill in **learn mode**: share your job statement and ask it to probe gaps
4. Use **identify-job mode** to refine the job definition using the framework
5. Use **segmentation mode** to test whether your job-based segmentation is stronger than the demographic alternative
6. Write your assignment — cite Christensen and the JTBD source papers

## What the skill will probe you on (learn mode)

- Is your job statement circumstantial or demographic? (Circumstantial = correct; demographic = surface-level)
- Have you addressed all three dimensions: functional, emotional, social?
- What are the forces preventing customers from switching to your solution?
- Is this a job your brand actually fulfils, or one it wishes it fulfilled?
- What innovation does the JTBD insight suggest — and why hasn't a competitor already done it?

---

## What your examiner will ask

- "What is the job your chosen brand is being hired to do? Cite evidence from customer behaviour, not assumptions."
- "How does JTBD-based segmentation differ from the demographic segmentation this company currently uses? Which is more useful and why?"
- "Apply Christensen's four forces to a specific customer switching decision in this category."
- "What innovation opportunity does the unmet job reveal?"
- "Why did Christensen argue that most marketing is malpractice? Do you agree in the context of this brand?"

## Academic integrity note

A JTBD analysis submitted without genuine customer or market insight is a framework exercise with no substance. Your examiner knows what a templated JTBD analysis looks like. The job statement must be specific, grounded in real customer behaviour, and defensible. That requires your research — not the AI's.
